Leonardo da Vinci: 10 cities where you can see his art
1. Milan Italy's largest ever exhibition dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci opens today (April 15), as part of the year's Milan Expo. Leonardo 1452-1519 will take place at the city's Palazzo Reale and includes paintings, drawings, sculptures and manuscripts, brought together from institutions including the British Museum in London, the Uffizi in Florence, and the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Highlights include drawings from the Atlantic Codex, his paintings St. John the Baptist, the Annunciation, and La Belle Ferronnière - which has just been restored - and the Vitruvian Man, only occasionally shown to the public. Visitors to Milan hoping to see Da Vinci's greatest gift to the city - The Last Supper, housed in the Santa Maria delle Grazie - need to book months in advance. If you can't get a slot, consider a guided tour - Tick Italy (tickitaly.com) has a wide range of options. Read more: the best hotels in Milan
Visitors to Milan should also visit the Sforza Castle, home to one of da Vinci's most extraordinary works - some 19 mulberry trees painted onto the walls of a cavernous chamber. "It's an extraordinary scheme; no one is entirely sure of the symbolism or inspiration behind the work," says Telegraph Travel's Nick Trend. "Certainly, it lacks the pictorial drama and narrative of the far more famous The Last Supper. But you will get only 15 minutes in front of that, and you must book weeks in advance. Here, in a little-visited corner of the Sforza Castle, you can sit in peace with Leonardo and let your mind drift among the leaves and branches.
2. Krakow The Royal Castle in Krakow, the seat of Polish kings for more than 500 years, is currently home to Poland's most treasured work of art, da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine. It depicts Cecilia Gallerani, the mistress of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. It will return to the city's Czartoryski Museum once ongoing renovations are complete. Read more: A weekend break in...
