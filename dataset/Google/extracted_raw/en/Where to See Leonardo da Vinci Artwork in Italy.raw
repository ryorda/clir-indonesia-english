Where to See Leonardo da Vinci Artwork in Italy
Painter, scientist, architect and Renaissance man Leonardo da Vinci left his imprint all over Italy in frescoes, buildings, drawings, and prototypes and blueprints for many of the world's technological milestones. While quite a few of Leonardo's masterpieces reside in museums outside of Italy, there are ample examples of the master's works in his native land. We have put together a list of places in Italy where you can follow the Leonardo trail (in alphabetical order by city name).

Uffizi Gallery, Florence
Arguably Italy's most important art museum, the Uffizi Gallery has a few of Leonardo's works. Paintings include the "Annunciation," "Adoration of the Magi," and a self-portrait. Leonardo is also represented by a number of sketches and under-drawings in the Prints and Drawings Collection in the Uffizi.

Palazzo Vecchio, Florence
The legend of Leonardo's massive painting "The Battle of Anghiari" lives on in the Palazzo Vecchio's Sale dei Cinquecento, although the painting is thought to be covered by a wall. On the exterior of the Palazzo Vecchio is a cornerstone imprinted with the silhouette of a man's face, thought to be Leonardo's unofficial signature.

The Last Supper, Milan
Along with the Mona Lisa, which is the prized possession of the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, "The Last Supper" is Leonardo's most famous painting. The Cenacolo Vinciano still resides in the refectory of the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, where Leonardo finished it in 1498.

Milan's Top Museums
Beyond The Last Supper, Milan holds several other Leonardo originals. Most obvious is the Leonardo da Vinci Science and Technology Museum, which has original Leonardo drawings as well as models based on the Renaissance man's innovations. The Codex Atlanticus, one of Leonardo's notebooks filled with extensive observations and drawings, is housed in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana. Another Codex - the Codex Trivulzianus, a study in architecture and religion â€“ is held at the Biblioteca Trivulziana in the Castello Sforzesco.

Vinci, Tuscany
Leonardo gets his name from the town of Vinci, the small village outside of Florence where he was born in 1452. Here you will find the Casa di Leonardo, the farmhouse where the master was born, and the Museo Leonardino, a science and technology museum dedicated to models based on the master's prolific drawings.
