Spanish daily outlines ETA's current structure and activities
Experts in the fight against terrorism suspect that Mikel Albizu, 
alias Mikel Antza, is located in Paris and that he is the author of ETA's 
latest communique, a Spanish daily reports. The separatist organization 
is economically sound and has managed to rebuild its electronic 
apparatus. The following is the text of a report by Spanish newspaper El 
Mundo web site on 25 April; subheadings as published: 
Madrid: After the breakdown of the cease-fire, he had stepped out of 
the limelight. From taking the lead role on the part of ETA in the 
conversations with representatives of the [Spanish] government, Mikel 
Albizu, Mikel Antza, was demoted in the group's executive power structure 
when the hopes built up during the period without assassinations 
[September 1998 to December 1999] were shattered. However, the capture of 
Javier Garcia Gaztelu, [alias] Txapote, ETA's real strongman after the 
failure of the cease-fire, [has meant that] Mikel Antza has recovered the 
prominence he previously enjoyed. 
According to information supplied to El Mundo by sources in the fight 
against terrorism, after the arrest of, firstly, Inaki de Gracia Arregi, 
[alias] Inaki de Renteria, and then later, of Txapote, Mikel Antza has 
once more taken political control of the terrorist organization. Experts 
situate him in Paris, far from the terrorists' military structure, 
occupying an important post in the organization once more and marking the 
political line of ETA's network. In fact, specialists consider it a 
primary hypothesis that the last communique to be sent by the terrorist 
organization was written by Mikel Antza.
