Somalia: Is government recruiting young Kenyans for war? · Global Voices
This is the first roundup of Somali blogs in 2009.
Yes, it's been more than a year since I took leave a long leave from blogging but now I'm back, for good.
This is the first post and expect more posts about Somali blogosphere.
Blogger Royale Somalia profiles a young female Somali doctor in Mogadishu who'd graduated last year, he writes:
In December 2008, 20 Somali students overcame huge odds and graduated from medical school in Mogadishu—the first batch to do so for almost two decades in the failed Horn of Africa state.
Dr. Hafsa Abdurrahman Mohamed, 26, was one of those receiving a diploma from the capital’s Benadir University.
Upon completing her studies, she decided to work for the Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), using her skills to help provide free medical care in Somalia.
The East African Philosopher comments on Somali President Sharif Ahmed's visit to US and the US government's policy shift in dealing with Sharif:
In December of 2006 Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, currently only-in-name president of the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia, was on the run from the Ethiopian army, the CIA, and the U.S. Rangers.
East African Philisophers continues:
This week Sheikh Sharif is in Minneapolis, MN (and the home of this crazy congresswoman) meeting with Congressmen, Governor, and city councilmen/mayor.
Couple of months ago he had a meeting with Secretary Clinton in Nairobi during her Africa trip.
From terrorist to president for Sheikh Sharif in just two years.
That, friends, must be a first.
To me this says a lot about the U.S.’s awful foreign policy than anything else.
The Kenya Somali Blog says Somali government is recruiting Somali youth from Kenya:
Somalia's U.N.-backed government has recruited more than 170 young Kenyans and former servicemen to help it fight rebels in the failed Horn of Africa state, local leaders in eastern Kenya said.
Mohamed Gabow, the mayor of Garissa, told Reuters the enrolment of ethnic Somali Kenyans was being conducted at a home in Bulla Iftin village, on the outskirts of his town.
The recruitment is not a secret.
Those involved are not worried.
They are going around all the villages to announce the exercise," Gabow said in an interview late on Thursday.
