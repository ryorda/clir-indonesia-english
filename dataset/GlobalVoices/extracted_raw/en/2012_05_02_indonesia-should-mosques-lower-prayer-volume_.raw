Indonesia: Should Mosques Lower Prayer Volume? · Global Voices
In a speech delivered during the national congress of the Indonesian Board of Mosques (DMI) last week, Vice President Boediono sparked a debate when he suggested that mosques should lower the volume of loudspeakers during the daily prayer call.
Mosques in Indonesia use loudspeakers to broadcast the “adzan” five times a day reminding people to pray.
Boediono warned that the loud volume might disturb other people, including fellow Muslims.
He added that a less noisy call to prayer is more likely to enter a person's heart rather than loud sounds.
But many Indonesians advised Boediono to address other more important issues.
