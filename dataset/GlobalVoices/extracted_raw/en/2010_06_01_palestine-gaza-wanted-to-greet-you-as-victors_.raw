Palestine: "Gaza wanted to greet you as victors" · Global Voices
People throughout the Middle East - and around the world - have been shocked and outraged at the news of the deaths on board the Freedom Flotilla early on Monday.
Palestinian bloggers reacted immediately to the news of Israel's raid on the Gaza-bound aid ships.

The students writing at Life on Bir Zeit Campus (Birzeit is a university in the West Bank) are astounded at Israel's actions:
What they have done in the early hours of today is unfathomable.
It is senseless.
It is horrific, unnecessary, and brutal.
The worst feeling is that of desolate hopelessness, knowing that you can't do anything, while these good souls on the flotilla have suffered death and injury and terrorizing at the hands of mentally challenged state.
Mutasharrid is a blogger from Gaza who is currently studying in the West Bank, and he writes about his feelings towards the passengers of the flotilla: Free people of the world.
Terrorists with an order from the army.
No, you didn't break the siege.
Your toes did not reach the shores, fertilised by Huda's tears and the blood of her sisters.
You did not built the sand castle of freedom there.
But you broke - may my soul be sacrificed for you - something bigger.
You broke the crystal image of the state built on make-up and falseness.
Into the sea, you threw its fake mask, and showed the fangs of a naval fleet, which was on full alert for a box of medicine and a wheelchair.

Ola, who blogs at From Gaza, writes in a post called Pirates of the Mediterranean: أو انه اصبح مقصورا على الخيال في أفلام هوليوود
فكر مرة أخرى !
أما أنتم يا شهداء أسطول الحرية ..
أردات غزة ان تستقبلكم كفاتحين .. فاستقبلتكم السماء كشهداء
تبكيكم امواج البحر والنوارس وشمس الغروب ..
For those who thought that the age of pirates had passed...
Or that it had become confined to fantasy in Hollywood movies…
Think again!
You, the martyrs of the freedom flotilla...
Gaza wanted to greet you as victors…but heaven greets you as martyrs...
The waves of the sea and the seagulls and the sunset all mourn for you...
