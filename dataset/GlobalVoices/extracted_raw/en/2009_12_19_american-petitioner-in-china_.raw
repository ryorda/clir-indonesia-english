American Petitioner in China · Global Voices
Julie Harms, an American and a Harvard graduate, hit the news as she becomes one of the few, or perhaps the first, foreign petitioner in China.
Her case was a grievance against the government that her fiancé, Liu Shiliang, was jailed on a charge which she says is not true.
She met Liu Shiliang a decade ago while traveling in China.
They were engaged in 2007, but the wedding was delayed because of a neighbor dispute that year, and Liu was arrested in June this year on a trespassing charge.
Julie decided to resort to the petition system in Beijing this year as she feels that the local judicial system has failed to resolve the dispute with justice.
The letter and visit petition system (xinfang) is an administrative system for hearing complaints and grievances from individuals in China.
The state and local bureaus of letters and visits are in charge of receiving letters, calls and visits from individuals or groups.
While the verdict of the case is still to be decided, the experience of petitioning must have let Julie realized the differences of the Chinese and American legal system.
As she has commented (from the news report above):
Local authorities are essentially counting on the fact that the local people don't have that much knowledge of the law.
I think it's a shame.
Comments on a sina forum point to the legal and cultural gap between China and the US:
