Indonesia: Online Nationalism Â· Global Voices
Last Friday's dual blasts marked the end of six years of a peaceful and sound Indonesia.
As the nation condemns the terror attacks, Indonesian youths show the spirit of nationalism online.
Many Indonesians are sending tweets like "We're not afraid" motto through #indonesiaunite, something that people wouldn't dare say bluntly, especially right after bombing incidents a few years ago.
Thanks to microblogging sites, Indonesian youths are able to get out of their fear shells and express themselves and their opinion.
