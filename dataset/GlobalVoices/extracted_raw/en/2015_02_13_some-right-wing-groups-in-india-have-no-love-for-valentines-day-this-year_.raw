Valentine's Day has become more and more popular over the last two decades in India, a trend that has alarmed certain camps in the country, who have sought to put a damper on the Western celebration of love and romance.
This year, Hindu Mahasabha, a right-wing Hindu nationalist political party, has announced that in the Indian city of Meerut they will force couples caught telling each other "I love you" in public or on social media will be forced to marry in an Arya Samaj wedding.
If the couple are of different religious faiths, then they have to go through a religious purification ritual, the group has warned.
Similarly, another political group, Kalinga Sena from the Indian state of Odisha, has announced they will patrol public spaces, videotape couples in "vulgar" acts and share the videos with the couples' parents.
Forcing the couple to marry is also apparently part of their Valentine's Day plan.
Many have decried the groups' intentions on social media as a violation of personal freedom and privacy.
Activist organization Jhatkaa encouraged people to sign a petition on Twitter:
#HinduMahasabha want to punish couples celebrating #ValentinesDay!
Sign this petition against #MoralPolicing http://t.co/WisHg5GygB

Unfortunately, moral policing isn't new to India.
In one high-profile case from 2009, another right-wing group Sri Rama Sene assaulted young women in a pub in the city of Mysore.
To protest the violence, a campaign called "Pink Chaddi campaign" (pink underwear campaign) was launched and went viral to the extent that people started sending pink underwear to Sri Rama Sene's office.
Internet jokes poking fun at the two groups' announcements have started populating social media.
One offers a tongue-and-cheek interpretation of Hindu Mahasabha's and Kalinga Sena's plans as supporting LGBT rights (gay marriage is not legally permitted in India):

If I express my love for a girl on Valentine's day, will we still get married?
Does this mean #HinduMahasabha supports LGBT?

Others used the news as inspiration for funny Internet memes:
Of all those tragic love stories and heart-broken youngsters who never got support of their family, I am sure Hindu Mahasabha will be a one stop solution, at least on Valentines's Day.
Journalist Debashis Tripathy compared Kalinga Sena's attempt at violating people's privacy to that of Hindu Mahasabha:
Kalinga Sena to videotape couples seen together on Valentine Day & send clippings to their parents.
Now beat that, Hindu Maha Sabha! #Odisha

Writer and commentator Sameera Khan objected to Hindu Mahasabha's act as a barrier preventing women from accessing public spaces:
It’s when women want to access public space for pleasure, to wander around, sit on a park bench and read, or hang out with a boyfriend, or as we say, to loiter, that is when Indian society is not okay with it.
Some have demanded that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi comment and stop Hindu Mahasabha.
Modi hasn't made any public statement so far, and Hindu Mahasabha hasn't released any further statements since it first announced its Valentine's Day plans.
#HinduMahasabha is nothing but a bunch of goons masquerading under the garb of protecting Hinduism, BJP should distance themselves from them

A satirical protest is planned in Delhi for Valentine's Day in front of Hindu Mahasabha's head office.
The Facebook event page has more than 1,700 people saying they will attend:
All struggling lovers of the world and otherwise!
Lets gather in heartfelt gratitude outside the Hindu Mahasabha's head office on Mandir Marg this Valentine's Day for the most EPIC mass marriage ceremony Delhi will ever see!
"SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE: Hindu Mahasabha Style!" a protest against Hindu Mahasabha's plan to marry off couples making public displays of affection on Valentine's Day.

As Valentine's Day approaches, police are keeping a vigil eye on vulnerable places.
Inspector General of the city of Meerut Alok Sharma told Times of India, "It might be Valentine's Day or any other day, no one has the right to do moral policing.
But if the members of the outfit involve themselves in any such activity, they should be ready to face legal action."
With global cultural finding more acceptance locally, the intolerance of some religious and political groups of people's changing lifestyles is disrupting the harmony of society.
Intolerance like this comes at great cost to the people, damaging human rights and personal freedom.
