South Korea: Halting Corporal Punishment In Schools Met With Opposition · Global Voices
South Korean society is buzzing with the old issue of corporal punishment on student, as an elementary teacher smacking, beating and kicking his students got leaked into public.
The corporal punishment, a widely discussed but practically ignored issue for decades in Korea, became the center of a controversy as the Seoul Education Office dismissed the teacher immediately and ordered a halt on physical punishment in every school.
This is a video of Mr. Oh, an elementary school teacher in Seoul beating his students.
The video was recorded by one of the students and later released to public by the parent’s association.
One of the students punished on that same day was taken was found out to be suffering from leukemia.
Oh was quite infamous in his school, even to the point students gave him a fearful nickname of Oh Jang-pong (掌風: Palm Blast) as Oh often smacked students by his palm, making them fell down to the ground.
The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education took a swift and unprecedentedly strong action.
It declared a full-out abolition of corporal punishment in every school starting from this coming fall semester and is considering enacting a ‘Student’s Human Rights Regulation’ to protect student's basic rights which customarily ignored.
Most Korean bloggers have greeted the news with enthusiasm, strongly supporting it as a long overdue measure.
The middle-aged conservative people, who themselves were the victims of corporal punishment in schools, however, are giving a suspicious look on the effectiveness of the new moves.
The Korean Federation of Teacher's Associations are expressing downright opposition to the news, worrying the abolition of corporal punishment may deteriorate the already undermined teacher’s authority.
The corporal punishment is not a legit way of teaching as defined by Korean education law which states teachers should ‘teach students with disciplines without inflicting physical pains with exception of inevitable cases’.
The loophole created by the vagueness of the ‘inevitable cases’ has caused confusion and misinterpretation.
Majority of bloggers are showing their absolute approvals to the Seoul Education Office’s decision.
The blogger OmegaPassion commented that it is time to redefine the word ‘Gyo-Pyeon’, a commonly used term in Korea referring the teacher’s post but which literally means a teacher’s rod or a teacher’s whip, interpreting the violent practice as the crisis of the democracy.
