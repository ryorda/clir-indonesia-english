India: The Pink Underwear Resistance · Global Voices
As a reaction to this event, on February 5th, the Pink Chaddi campaign was kicked off by a few people who posted up a Facebook group online called “Consortium of Pub-going, Loose and Forward Women”.
They decided on a sassy, bold move to send pink colored women’s panties to the Ram Sena party as a ‘Valentine's gift’.
More than the actual physical action of couriering underwear to a political party office, it is the concept alone which is buzzing on the minds of everyone in India.
Videos and photographs of the Pink Chaddis are also being collected to be sent to the Ram Sena, as can be seen both on the Facebook group picture page.
On the Pink Chaddi Campaign official blog, it is said that:
We have heard that Mr. Muthalik has decided to send pink saris "with love" in response.
We greatly appreciate this and hope he continues to choose similar, non-violent methods to get his point across, just as we have chosen to be non-violent and loving in response to the brutality of the attacks on lovers and women in Mangalore and other parts of Karnataka.
Nevertheless, women from all over India, especially in Bangalore, where the campaign began, are preparing to send their personalized ‘chaddis’, which are underpants, to the Ram Sena party leader, Mr. Muthalik, who has been the man in charge.
The irony is that in a ‘land of Kamasutra’, women all over India have to fight for their rights, for their security, for their freedom and sexuality.
One woman, Ree Diwan, posts in the Facebook group an image of pink underpants with "India, the Land of the KamaSutra" overlaid on it, and Patricia Chandrashekar, comments:
can't believe this is happening in the land of KamaSutra.
Send these guys on a trip to Khajuraho.
Let them see for themselves.
The erotic statues are not even wearing chuddies!
We'll have to wait and see how the avalanche of Valentine's Day panties is received by the Ram Sena.
