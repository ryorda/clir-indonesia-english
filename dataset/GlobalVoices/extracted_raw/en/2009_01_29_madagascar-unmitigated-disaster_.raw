Madagascar: "Unmitigated Disaster" Â· Global Voices
( Soldiers in burned block by Mehmoud Karim) )
After two days of upheaval that resulted in an estimated death toll at 80 nationally, and the looting of dozens of stores, a day of relative calm greeted a stunned nation.
Soldiers are now patrolling Antananarivo, and both parties have called for supporters to stand down.
The mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, called for a "ghost town" operation in the capital today, January 29th, urging supporters to stay at home, but attend an organized public demonstration on Saturday, January 31st.
President Ravalomanana met with his executive cabinet as well as religious leaders to find a solution to the current instability.
Many foreign embassies have issued alerts to their citizens about carefully considering traveling to Madagascar.
Bloggers reflect on what many locally called "Black Monday" as confusion and anger prevail.
Mialisoa Randriamampianina writes that both sides should take responsibility for this "unmitigated disaster"(fr):
Yesterday the U.S. ambassador met with Ravolamanana to try and talk sense to him, but bore little fruit.
His car was attacked/rocked by a mob after leaving the meeting.
Now the economic impact is more threatening than the violence.
Gas prices have skyrocketed, food will soon follow.
Gas stations are like parking lots, lines around the block, and most are out of gas.
