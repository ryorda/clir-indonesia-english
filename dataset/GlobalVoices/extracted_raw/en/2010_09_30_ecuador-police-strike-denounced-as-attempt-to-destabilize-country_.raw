Ecuador: Police Strike Denounced as Attempt to Destabilize Country · Global Voices
Tension.
That is the word that summarizes the current situation in Ecuador.
A police strike began today when a group of Ecuadorian policemen shut down Quito's international airport and the main regiment of the city in a protest against President Rafael Correa.
The strike began at 8 this morning in the Nº1 Regiment in Quito against changes to the Public Service Law, which reduced benefits for various public entities.
In an attempt to dialogue with the police, President Correa suffered a tear gas assault and is being treated at the Metropolitan Hospital in Quito.
Events are developing rapidly, with new information emerging from various sources since this morning.
On Twitter, citizens report cases of roadblocks, assaults and bank robberies, while sharing their different views on the events.
La Patilla developed a comprehensive graphic summary where it also informs about Correa's words when he faced the police, telling them, "Kill me if you want."
Various social organizations and institutional websites have announced their support for the President outside government buildings, according to reports from the independent media source ALER .
