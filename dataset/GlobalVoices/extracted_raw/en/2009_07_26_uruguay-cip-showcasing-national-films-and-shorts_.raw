Uruguay: CIP, Showcasing National Films and Shorts Â· Global Voices
They call it an alternative to online video channels so that their videos don't have to compete for attention with short home-videos of birthdays, cats and lip synching to music.
Two young Uruguayans decided to change the situation and created Cip, a website dedicated to showcasing the works of independent film-makers, so they can take their films out of their desk drawers and share them with a wider community, much in the same way that it works in theaters, with premieres, seasons and different viewing rooms.
