Brazil: Most Violent State in the Country Protests for Peace · Global Voices
As I write this post, I read a piece of news about a teenager who was shot dead on the city streets of Maceio, Brazil, on the night of Tuesday May 29, 2012, while at least three other bodies of victims of violence were received at the capital's institute of forensic medicine.
Just a few hours before these recent crimes, thousands of people - mobilised through social networks - took the streets in the "Walk for Peace", an appeal to end violence in the city's coastal state of Alagoas.
For a long time the population of Alagoas has become indignant by the trivialisation of life and the growing number of murders for trivial reasons .
The last straw causing the mobilisation was the assassination of 67-year-old doctor José Alfredo Vasco Tenorio on the afternoon of May 26, following an armed robbery.
In the same weekend alone, 17 other people came to violent deaths in Alagoas.
The floor where the doctor was murdered was stained with 'blood' footprints.

The untenable insecurity of the situation led people to protest on the streets in a demonstration organised through the Facebook group Alagoas – Estado de Emergência (Alagoas - State of Emergency) .
After the protest on Monday evening, Silvana Chamusca provided a summary of the event, with an overview of the debate that followed the peaceful walk "whose single goal was to show our indignation, without looking at social class":
