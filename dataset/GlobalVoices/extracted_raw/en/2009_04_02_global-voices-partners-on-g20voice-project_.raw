Global Voices
As part of the G20Voice project, 50 bloggers from around the world have gathered in London to act as our "eyes and ears" as world leaders convened today (April 2) in London for the G20 Summit.
The bloggers come "from 22 different countries, and between them represent a global audience of over 14 million readers and online participants."
Global Voices is pleased to have been a partner on the G20Voice project, along with Oxfam Great Britain, Save the Children, One, and Blue State Digital.
