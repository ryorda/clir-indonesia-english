Coptic Churches Burnt in Egypt · Global Voices
Coptic churches and businesses were attacked across Egypt today by what was described as Muslim Brotherhood members and their supporters.
The sectarian attacks followed the violent evacuation of Pro-Morsi sit-ins in the capital Cairo, in which many Egyptians were killed and injured.
On social media, many suggested that the Muslim Brotherhood has been fanning the flames of sectarianism, pitting Muslim against Christian, resulting in today's unprecedented wide-scale attacks.
The two sit-ins were for the supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood member, whose one-year reign was cut short on July 3, following massive protests calling for him to resign and for early elections.
For weeks, Morsi and Muslim Brotherhood supporters have been camping in Rabaa Al Adawiya, in Nasr City, and in Al Nahda Square, near Cairo University, calling for the return to “legitimacy” or reinstating Morsi as the legally elected president of Egypt.
Researcher in the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights Ishak Ibrahim tweets :
The toll for today's attacks in nine governorates is as follows: 20 churches, one monastery, two service buildings, three schools, three religious societies and one orphanage were burnt and seven churches were attacked and looted
In another tweet, he explains:
The targeting by the Muslim Brotherhood and their supporters of courts, churches, town councils and police stations is due basically to their disbelief in the state

Firas Al Atraqchi explains:
The attacks on Coptic institutions in #Egypt betrays the understanding that an Islamist government can never be inclusive.
Or tolerant. — Firas Al-Atraqchi (@Firas_Atraqchi) August 14, 2013
And Leil_Zahra Mortada notes:
You can be against #MB, and still denounce the massacre of the army and #MOI, and be against the sectarian crimes against the #Copts. #Egypt — Leil-Zahra Mortada (@LeilZahra) August 14, 2013

I'm sorry for ever being a part of jan25....that deteriorated to reach the point we're living in right now.
