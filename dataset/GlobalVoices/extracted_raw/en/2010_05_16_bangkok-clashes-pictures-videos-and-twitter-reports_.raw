Thailand Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva will not back down as he ordered the military to continue the operations against Red Shirt protesters in Bangkok.
Abhisit insists the violent dispersal of protesters is justified to bring back stability in the capital.
He also accused a minority of Red Shirt “terrorists” of trying to instigate more violence in the country.
The Red Shirts have been protesting in the streets for the two months already.
They are demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister whom they accuse of being illegitimate and undemocratic.
They also want the Prime Minister to dissolve the parliament and call for new elections.
There were negotiations to settle the protest peacefully but they bogged down a few days ago.
The initial members of the Red Shirt movement were supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra but today the Red Shirt is also composed of groups and individuals who want democratic reforms in Thai society.

Eyewitness accounts have been uploaded on the web.
For example, Nick Nostitz was inside the "killing zone”.
Vaitor and Riding out the Economy also posted their observations of the clashes.
A Facebook user posted this entry, “What should I feel when I wake up one day with the dead bodies of Thais in front of my house?”
But netizens are questioning the authenticity of this expose.
Are they fake dead bodies?

Kishen, writing for New Mandala, is worried about the social, political and economic impact of the ongoing clashes
But everyone is fighting it out without considering the enormous economic and political ramification to Thailand as a whole.
Thailand’s economic growth for the year will be badly hampered if matters prolong.
As it is this year’s drought will have a telling impact on country’s exports of agri-produce.
As such, the wounds inflicted on Thailand’s psyche and image in the next few days could have a lasting impact on Thailand future growth as a nation.
That’s a greater wound that all the grenades, .308 bullets and armoured personal carriers can inflict on the Thai people
News in Bangkok speculates that journalists were deliberately targeted by snipers
I suspected that the shooting of the reporters seemed intentional.
I suspected that the intentional targeting of reporters were to prevent them from filming the carnage.
I now feel more confident that I am right.
Jon, via Greg to Differ, writes about the role of social media in monitoring the Bangkok clashes
Social media has played a major role in reporting the details of the Bangkok protests across the world.
Powerful images, compelling video footage, personal accounts and opinion have been amplified by Twitter, Facebook and blogs to the point where social media is a valuable accompaniment to media reports.

Twitter reactions about the raging urban battles in Bangkok
ellymedan: Please don't believe what you see on CNN about #Thailand.
Very pro the #redshirt who has taken #Bangkok hostage
sutatip_b: RT @BangkokBill: In light of everything last night I think it is now fair to say that there is a #redshirt protest and a redshirt insurgency
seacorro: Has anyone actually seen with their own eyes a #redshirt with a gun or more to the point firing one?
Ive seen makeshift weapons onl
tulpin: i guess the #redshirt leaders will hold people hostage like this and try to find a way to flee the scene when they have the opportunity
