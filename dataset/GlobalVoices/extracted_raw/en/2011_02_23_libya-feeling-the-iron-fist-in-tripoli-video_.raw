Libya: Feeling the Iron Fist in Tripoli (Videos) · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Libya Uprising 2011.
What is happening in Tripoli?
Libyans outside the capital — and the rest of the world — wonder, shuddering to think of the levels of depravity Muammar Al Gaddafi will stoop to keep control on the country.
During his speech Tuesday, February 22, Gaddafi vowed to go door-to-door to crush opponents, using terms one former ally claims is an invitation to genocide for Libya's remaining loyal troops and mercenaries.
As protesters, and defecting members of the military, claim to control the eastern part of the country — the Gaddafi regime's hold on Libya appears to be tenuous.
But information from the capital city is nearly impossible to come by.
Tripoli is closed off to foreign media.
Libya's government did tell people to return to work — via text message — and some were seen shopping for food.
Reports of two Libyan naval gunships are reportedly facing the city.
One report said the days in Tripoli are eerily quiet while death squads and gangs roam the city at night, spreading violence.

A source from Tripoli has confirmed to us that Al Zawiya Street hospital seen many rape victim admittances last night.
Such deplorable and sickening actions were committed after Gaddafi’s speech in which he called for door-to-door cleansing of the city from those who are against his regime.
Warning: Here are graphic photos from the Libyan Youth Movement Facebook page claiming to be taken from a Tripoli hospital.
Those on Twitter also have problems finding information coming from the city.
