Japan: Fear in Fukushima Â· Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage on the Japan Earthquake 2011.
The day after a 8.9-magnitude earthquake struck Japan, an explosion at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, 150 miles north of Tokyo, is causing both fear and confusion online about what may happen next.
So far, the nuclear reactors themselves are alleged to be unharmed, and the worst radiation is contained.
Still, thousands of people are being evacuated from around two nuclear power plants in the Fukushima Prefecture.
Many references have been made to the devastating Chernobyl disaster in the USSR in 1986, but it's still not clear how big the damage will be in Japan nor how many human lives it will cost.
As an indicator of worry, one of the latest new hashtags is #save_fukushima.
