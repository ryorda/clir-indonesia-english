Morocco: French Made TGV Rail Project Causes Controversy Â· Global Voices
On Thursday 29 September, 2011, President Sarkozy of France visited Morocco to oversee the launch of construction work on a new TGV rail link between the cities of Tangier and Casablanca.
The French made high-velocity train is due to start operating by December 2015 and is worth an estimated 20 billion dirhams (US$2.4 billion).
Moroccan state-run news agency M.A.P. boasts that "Morocco is the first country of Africa and the Arab world to have such a technologically advanced rail transport grid."
At a ceremony chaired by King Mohammed VI of Morocco and President Sarkozy, the Moroccan Minister of Transport Karim Ghellab explained that the TGV is expected to generate new jobs and offer training opportunities in rail professions for Moroccan jobseekers.
The project is, however, causing a stir in the Moroccan blogosphere.
Bloggers are raising questions about the motives behind the scheme and asking whether their country needs a project that costly.

Back then, the Moroccan government preferred the United States' Lockheed Martin F-16 fighter jets to the French Dassault Rafales.
Morocco offered to purchase the French TGV system to console Sarkozy, the blogger explains.
