Japan: Worries about spread of HIV and AIDS Â· Global Voices

There are some alarming statistics about the spread of HIV and AIDS in Japan.
While the rest of the developed world UNAIDS reported that the cases of infection are decreasing, Japan seems to be the only such country where the number of HIV positives and AIDS infected people is growing.
According to the AIDS Trend Committee, 2008 was the year with the highest number of new cases recorded: 432 people were diagnosed with AIDS and 1113 as HIV positive.
So far the statistics for 2009 are no more reassuring: for in June, 249 people were diagnosed HIV+ and 124 with AIDS.
Patients are mostly male, homosexual and in their 20s and 30s.
Among the causes is often cited the lack of information and need for a campaign to raise awareness of the problem, especially in the gay community.
While organizations such as WADS , JFAP and others seek to raise the level of public awareness especially among the young and young adults to the matter, government policies have not proved to be very effective so far.
With the recent general election and the new elected DPJ, there is hope that policies on HIV/AIDS issue will be considered more seriously though none of the competing parties addressed the problem in their manifestos.
An anonymous comment on the AIDS & Society Association's blog highlights this point.
