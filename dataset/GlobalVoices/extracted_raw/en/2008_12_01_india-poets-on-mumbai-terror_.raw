This post is part of the Global Voices special coverage on the terror attacks in Mumbai, India on November 26, 2008.
Nothing articulates your heart like a poem.
Sometimes the complex composition of a poem simplifies complex issues of life, sometimes it helps you come in terms with your surroundings.
Poets from India are saddened by the recent terror attacks in Mumbai.
You will find them asking questions in their poetry and sometime they are even answering them for us.
Here are a few snippets of their expressions.

A 12-year-old girl from Bangalore sets her thoughts on fire.
Soon after the tragic news of the hostages at Nariman House being killed was aired, Lavanya shut herself in her room for about 15 minutes and later handed her dad Anand Krishna with a poem titled ‘The city that never slept, slept’.
More lives are lost,
More battles fought.
The war was raging on,
The guns just fire everywhere,
Victory goes to no one.
The terrorists may be killed,
But the void of the lost loved one is never filled.
The roads are empty, there is no sound.
Mumbai, the city that never slept,
Slept long, deep and sound.
Vivek Sharma at Desicritics used metaphors from epic Indian Tales to describe the Mumbai terror in his poem, “Mumbai burns”:
Did you see the sobbing reporter describe how the Taj of Mumbai burns?
How many will Asuras (devils) cause to die before O Vishnu as avataar returns?
The fanatic bullet hunts gazelles everywhere that nostalgia mourns.
Where is the machine crafted that chokes our unfinished yearns?
Teal titles her poem ‘Battle without a cause’ at ~ Spero ergo sum ~.
She ultimately longs for peace.
But her never ending questions are opaque:
Has the power at center gone completely callous
focused on nothing, but creating chaos, raucous?
How many more to die, how many more to lose
Until they get the backbone to act, and set loose
The act of retribution, against these evil minions
Who, despite education and well bringing, act heinous
How dare you take away something that god has given?
How can you walk on, like nothing ever happened?
Sandhya Ramachandran cannot smile in peace anymore.
She finds no place to go and hide from terror in her poem, “Why can’t I smile in peace?”
I seem to have no streets
to run and play and fall!
There is no place to cycle
no place to hide and crawl
I am a little kid of seven
with her book and toys and doll
Why can't I smile in peace
It is my world too, after all!
Ashq, a 28 year old engineer from Rajasthan wants to know when all this will end.
He titles his Hindi poem, “Aakhir kab tak?”
(Untill when?).
