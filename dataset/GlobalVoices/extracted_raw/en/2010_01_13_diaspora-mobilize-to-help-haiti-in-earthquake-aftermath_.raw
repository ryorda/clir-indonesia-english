Diaspora mobilize
The Haitian Diaspora have been mobilizing to support Haiti with its financial support and its prayers, and by exchanging information about missing family members.

If all of @wyclef followers text YELE to 501501 to donate $5, that would be $6,535,190 for relief efforts
Many on Twitter have warned about donating to fraudulent organizations. reduceharm writes:
Pls give to orgs that'll actually do sustainable work in Haiti and have some credibility on the ground
and advocates giving to groups like Yele, Catholic Relief, and Partners in Health.
Looking for Loved Ones
Most of Port-au-Prince is still without power, phone lines are down, and many have still not been able to reach their friends and family.

Damn.
Pray for Haiti, y'all.
7.0 earthquake came through..situation is dire out there right now.
I just lost family.
The Livesay Weblog:
There are friends and co-workers that are missing.
People whom no-one can account for.
People we work with and love.
There are more than I can name, but in particular we wait on one single friend who lived near the Hotel Montana – which has reportedly collapsed.
The horror has only just begun and I beg you to get on your knees – I truly mean ON YOUR KNEES and pray for the people of this country.
The news might forget in a few days - but people will still be trapped alive and suffering.
Pray.
Pray.
Pray.
After that - PLEASE PRAY.
