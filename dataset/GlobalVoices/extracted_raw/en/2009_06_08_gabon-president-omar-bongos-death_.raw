Gabon: On President Omar Bongo's death · Global Voices
Sunday night, French media announced the death of President Omar Bongo of Gabon, who had spent 41 of his 73 years in power.
French newspaper Le Point reported that they received news of his death, by cancer, in a private clinic in Barcelona, through a "source close to the President's entourage".
AFP, on the other hand, reported a French governmental source.
But later Prime Minister Jean Eyeghe Ndong told Gabonese TV that he had been "very surprised" to read the reports.
When Omar Bongo was admitted in Barcelona's Quirón clinic earlier in May, a comment by Akin a the African Loft predicted his death away from his subjects:
The greatest indictment of his lamentable regime of 42 years is that Gabon does not have hospitals that could treat either himself or his wife.
What kind of leadership is one that cannot bring any appreciable benefits to its people whilst the leaders jet off to foreign lands for the slightest sign of discomfort?
This is an indictment that applies to probably the whole of African leadership, the inability to raise the standards of infrastructure, education, health and opportunity.
When would we be able to make all leadership really accountable for their years of disservice?
The morale of this sordid tale is unAfrican in its context, the king shall not die in his palace surrounded by his subjects who “adore” him but in a non-descript expensive hospital room surrounded by strangers.
A king that fails to rule with probity will die in a distance in disgrace with everyone breathing a long sigh of relief - Good riddance!
To them all.
Togolese blogger Rodrigue Kopgli, of Jeunesse Unie pour la Démocratie en Afrique , called Bongo "one of the last crocodiles of Françafrique":
