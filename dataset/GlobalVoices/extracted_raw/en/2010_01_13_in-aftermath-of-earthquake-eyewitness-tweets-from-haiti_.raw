In aftermath of earthquake, eyewitness tweets from Haiti Â· Global Voices
As a result of the catastrophic 7.0 earthquake that hit the island country this evening (January 12), "Haiti" is currently a trending topic on Twitter.
Among the mass of retweets of mainstream media reports and tweets sending prayers and good wishes to the Caribbean island nation, have been eyewitness reports from musician and hotelier Richard Morse, who tweets as @RAMHaiti.
Morse posted his initial tweet around 6:00pm Haiti time, reporting that:
were ok at the oloffson ..internet is on !! no phones ! hope all are okay..alot of big building in PAP are down !
A series of tweets sent an hour later reported:
Just about all the lights are out in Port au Prince.. people still screaming but the noise is dying as darkness sets.
lot's of rumors about which buildings were toppled..The Castel Haiti behind the Oloffson is a pile of rubble..it was 8 stories high
Our guests are sitting out in the driveway.. no serious damage here at the Oloffson but many large buildings nearby have collapsed
I'm told that parts of the Palace have collapsed..the UNIBANK here on Rue Capois has collapsed people are bringing people by on stretchers
Port au Prince is dark except for a few fires
A huge hospital that was being built across from the Oloffson has collapsed cars are starting to circulate..I see lights in the distance towards the wharf
Later, Morse re-tweeted @isabelleMORSE, who reported " much destruction on Grand Rue (Ave Dessalines) Daniel Morel's ok.
Police Sta, Cathedral, Downtown teleco, Church St Anne all destroyed".
Just after 7:30pm Haiti time, Morse wrote that:
