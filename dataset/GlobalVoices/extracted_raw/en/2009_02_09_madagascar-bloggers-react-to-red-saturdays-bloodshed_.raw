Madagascar : Bloggers react to Red Saturday's bloodshed Â· Global Voices
Since riots and lootings claimed fifty dead in Madagascar on January 26, the situation has become bleaker.
Saturday, February 07 was an even bloodier day.
Dubbed "Red Saturday" by some, it saw the presidential guard fire upon a crowd of protesters who had gathered outside the Presidential palace of Ambohitsirohitra.
The crowd had marched to the palace where it wanted to install Monja Roindefo.
Roindefo had minutes before been nominated "Prime Minister" by Andry Rajoelina, himself proclaimed "President", by the protestors that started demonstrating in December, when Andry Rajoelina's TV station was shut down by the Ravalomanana government.
The protests have since become violent, resulting in lootings and riots, and with its supporters demanding Ravalomanana's resignation.
Among the victims of Red Saturday was Ando Ratovonirina, a 26 year old cameraman for the television station RTA.
He is no stranger to the Malagasy Global Voices team, as he was the one who reported on citizen media in Antananarivo, as encouraged by FOKO, a Rising Voices grantee.
Bloggers have reacted strongly to the news, struggling to understand what circumstances led Malagasies to fire upon each other.
Bloggers discuss who bears final responsibility for the massacre: those who incited, then led, demonstrators to the presidential palace, knowing that it was marked a "red zone" and that the soldiers there would have liberty to fire upon anyone violating the "red zone", therefore creating "martyrs" for a protest movement running out of steam; or those who gave the orders to shoot.
