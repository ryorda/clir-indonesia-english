While former Côte d'Ivoire President Laurent Gbagbo is still holed up in a bunker in the country, resisting arrest for continuing to deny his loss of the 2010 presidential election, the participation of France in the bid to oust him is raising reactions amongst French politicians and citizens , as well as within the African community in France.

The problem of Côte d'Ivoire concerns all Africans we warn the international community and France to stop what they are doing in Côte d'Ivoire
Referring to what happened in Cameroon during the war of independence in the country, he adds:
Today we are understanding that it's true that France killed our parents 50 years ago
Embassy difficulties
French Defense Minister Gérard Longuet reported to the French Senate Commission on Foreign Affairs on the morning of April 7, 2011.
He reported that the forces protecting Laurent Gbagbo number around 1,000 and explained that the main difficulty regarding the intervention of the presidential palace in Cocody (where Gbagbo is hiding) is the presence of numerous foreign embassies surrounding it.
The latter are fast becoming strategical and tactical points:
