Guinea: Outrage, Grief After Brutal Massacre Â· Global Voices
Still under tight police surveillance, Guinea ended several days of official mourning today for those killed in the sudden and shocking massacre of opposition protesters on Monday.
An estimated 157 (probably many more) unarmed demonstrators were shot down, knifed or clubbed to death by army soldiers in and around the "28 September Stadium", where the opposition forces coalition, "Forces vives," had called for a demonstration against military head of state Dadis Camara and his intention to run for president during the January 2010 election.
Tragically, this stadium is named after the date Guinea celebrated its independence from France, on September 28, 1958.
It is now set to become Conakry's second landmark of torture and mass murder, after the infamous Camp Boiro.

On the very same day, Guinean blogger Konngol Afirik wrote with cold rage , from Europe :
Guinea is naturally quite wealthy.
It's not easy to just force down a regime through external pressure.
The Conte regime survived years of the suspension of European aid without ever caving in to the EU's demands for political reform.
Uproar in Germany
Meanwhile, Guinea's plight has raised another controversy.
When it became known in Germany, where Dadis Camara received military training, that he spoke German and always sported the German paratrooper badge on his red army beret, the German department of defence stated that training for foreign officers in Germany was promoted by the German government in order to further democracy abroad and that "Berlin was not to blame if the officers embarked on a different course when they returned home."
Outrage erupted over ten pages of comments on newsites Die Welt :
