Tunisia: Ammar 404 is Back and Censoring Blogs Again Â· Global Voices
After a short hiatus, the dreaded Ammar 404 has once again attacked the Tunisian blogosphere.
Ammar is the nickname given by Tunisian bloggers to the censorship machine plaguing their access to the Internet and his victim this time is Zig Zag blog by 3amrouch.
It seem that the blog has been censored for republishing screen shots of a Canadian newspaper which unveils a real estate transaction in which the Tunisian President's son-in-law Mohamed Sakhr El Matri bought a villa in Canada for a huge amount of money - information which the Tunisian Government wants to hide from its people.
Many bloggers wrote about this censorship and condemned it.
