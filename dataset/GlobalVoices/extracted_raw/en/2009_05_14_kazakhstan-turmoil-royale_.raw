Kazakhstan: Turmoil Royale Â· Global Voices
Rakhat Aliev, former son-in-law of the Kazakhstani president, former ambassador in Austria and former Kazakh oligarch, sentenced to 40 years in jail for abduction of the people, leadership of the mafia-type organization and attempt of the coup, keeps on creating a "democrat's" image by leaking discrediting materials against top officials.
Earlier this week his book "The Godfather-in-Law" has been issued.
It's first edition was published in Germany, in German language.
As Aliev himself says,
Europe still has little knowledge of what is happening in Kazakhstan.
This fact allows EU politicians to put a blind eye on repressions and righs violations.
There are few comments to this post.
Some of them are glad about the publication. heil-jonny says he'll definitely buy a book, while mimi7777777 offers translation services.
yeresim is skeptical :
I could have regarded this book differently, if the author were a consistent fighter against the regime.
But you - you have become what you are thanks to your fother-in-law.
And now you try to present yourself as a democrat, using discrediting materials against this man.
Are you so naive to think that the Kazakh people will be happy to see you again, ever?
I don't think so.
And this is your traged.
thousand_pa tries to clarify :
Does this book tell the reader how a man on public service managed to get large enterprises in private property, to own Nurbank , media and advertising holdings, shreholdings in a number of Kazakhstani and foreign companies?
Besides, the checking of users who leave positive comments Aliev's blog shows that most of them are fake accounts with no entries and a couple of comments in personal history.
