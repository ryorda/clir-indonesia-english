Video: Chile Earthquake through Citizen's Eyes Â· Global Voices
Santiago After the Earthquake by pviojo CC-By
As the day comes to a close, more videos crop up of the devastating 8.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Chile at 3:30 am.
The earthquake, which not only affected the mainland through the ground movements, also generated tsunami waves that set out an alarm throughout the Pacific as different nations prepared for the waves to hit their shores.
Some videos were made during the earthquake itself, as this amateur video found on YouTube.
It starts with a shot of a computer in a room, and as the earth moves the rumble of the earth can be heard, then the lights go out and we are left in the dark, hearing only the voices of a woman and a man we assume to be the one holding the camera trying to calm her down.

As daylight came, more people went out to the streets and recorded the damage they observed:
Netprox drove through the highway, and had to squeeze under a fallen bridge to get through.
Rafael Vial also went out to the streets and recorded a collapsed bridge in Llaillay, Chile, which he streamed through his mobile phone on Qik.
