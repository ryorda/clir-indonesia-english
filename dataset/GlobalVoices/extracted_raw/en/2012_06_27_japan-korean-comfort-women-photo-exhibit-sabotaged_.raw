Korean 'Comfort Women' Photo Exhibit Sabotaged in Japan · Global Voices
Ahn Se-Hong, a South Korean photographer was harassed leading up to and during his exhibition in Japan, where he displayed pictures of aging 'Comfort Women,' a term used for Korean women that were drafted as sex slaves by the Japanese during World War II.
Ahn disclosed that he is facing threats from Japanese right wing groups, who held protests against the photo exhibition.
On his Facebook page photographer Ahn Se-Hong (ahnsehong) revealed that during his exhibition, he was closely watched, placed under surveillance and his visitors were thoroughly searched by security hired by Nikon, the Japanese camera maker, who also owned the building where the exhibit was on display.
Nikon first refused to sponsor the location and abruptly cancelled the event a month ago.
However, Nikon eventually succumbed to the Tokyo District Court order to sponsor the location.
News media speculated Nikon's abrupt canceling of the exhibit was an attempt to fend off the controversy and pressure from conservative groups.
The South Korean online space erupted with rage and countless users accused Japanese extremist right-wing groups of not only refusing to admit their war crimes, but attempting to sabotage the art exhibition.
Ahn’s show “Layer by Layer: Korean women left behind in China who were comfort women of the Japanese military,” shows faces of innocent victims who were dragged into inexplicably horrid situations in their teens or early twenties, now wrinkled and crippled.
During Japanese colonization, approximately 50,000 to 200,000 Korean women were kidnapped and forced to leave their homes to become military sex slaves.
Less than 70 percent of these women managed to return home.
