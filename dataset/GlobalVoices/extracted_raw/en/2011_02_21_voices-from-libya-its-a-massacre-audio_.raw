As the scale of atrocities carried out by the Libya's government's against protesters begins to mount, people around the world have been clamoring for reliable information.
It's very difficulty in a country where foreign media has found it hard to penetrate and the government has attempted to restrict service to the internet and cell phones.
Yet, the online group feb17voices has begun interviewing and collecting audio testimonies of people throughout Libya.
This is the same group behind the jan25voices during the demonstrations that toppled Egypt's long-serving president Honsi Mubarek.
What feb17voices has created is a very personal and immediate perspective of the protests and how people are dealing with the chaos and violence.
Here is a sampling of feb17voices from the group's channel on the audioBoo website.
