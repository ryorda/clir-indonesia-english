France: Demonstration in Paris Against Gabon Dictatorship · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage of Gabon Unrest 2011.
The small West African country of Gabon has been experiencing weeks of political tension, as two governments - official and unofficial - have both lain claim to the presidency.
On Sunday 27 February, 2011, self-proclaimed unofficial president André Mba Obame left the United Nations Development Programme building in capital Libreville, where he had been taking refuge.
The day before, 7,000 people gathered in the streets of French capital Paris to demonstrate against African dictators and the French government's alleged collusion with African dictatorial regimes.
Protesters left from Place de la République and headed to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, via 51 rue de l'Université, where Ali Bongo Ondimba (current official Gabonese president) owns a 140 million Euro mansion.
Both Gabonese and Libyan activists were present in the procession.
