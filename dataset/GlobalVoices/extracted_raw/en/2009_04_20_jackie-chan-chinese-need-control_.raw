Jackie Chan: Chinese need control · Global Voices
"I'm mot sure if it's good to have freedom or not, I'm really confused now.
If there is too much freedom, like the way Hong Kong is today, it is very chaotic; Taiwan is also chaotic.
I'm gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled." - Jackie Chan, Hong Kong and Hollywood's action movie star, spoke at a panel on "Tapping into Asia's Creative Industry potential" in Hainan, a southern province in China n 18 April 2009. (more from wtop)
China Law Blog considers Jackie Chan a racist for making such comment:
The title sums up my initial reaction to the news of Jackie Chan dissing the Chinese people by essentially saying they are too messed up to ever be able to handle democracy.
I was going to write a blog post criticizing Chan for his comments and noting how the same thing has been said about other countries that are now democracies (the United States, Japan,
West Germany, Italy, Spain and South Korea immediately come to mind).
Then I decided I am not the right person to write such a post, so I didn't.
When compared with western media's reports, it seems that local people are less surprised by the news, as Joanna replied in the comment section of China Law Blog:
What Chan said is something I was told thousands of times since I was born, but the unusual point this time is that he is a celebrity and he is from Hongkong -the freest area in China, but also the most colonial area in Chinese history (Maybe that's why it sounds somewhat racist to western ears).
He said: "I'm gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled.
If we are not being controlled, we'll just do what we want."
Yes, people should be controlled (by what?to what extent?), or they'll just do what they want — but the government should be controlled also, or it'll just do what it wants too.
How sad is that only the former half can be told, and can be said.
Btw, this part of Chan's speech wasn't reported by mainland China's media.
He was again reported as a patriot, telling the young people to love China and to be proud of chinese culture, not the foreign countries'.
The power just doesn't like anyone talking about anything related to politics.
In Hong Kong, many people are disapointed, Uncle Ray said that Jackie Chan is heartless to talk like that:
