Egypt: Excellent Cat Meows for President Mubarak Â· Global Voices
Mo-ha-med posted a note about Mumtaz El Qott's article where he mentioned that Egyptians want to get visas to Germany to wish President Mubarak a speedy recovery after his surgery.

Mumtaz El Qott is editor-in-chief of government newspaper Al-Akhbar.
Akhbar once used to have a little bit of an edge over Al-Ahram - a few of their columnists did veer away from the party line at times - but now it's just a second-tier state propaganda medium.
Mr El Qott - whose first name means "Excellent" and his last "the cat", wrote an incredibly ridiculous article - entitled 'Thank God you're well'.
The Twittersphere found it so hilarious that a new hastag was created: #ExcellentNawNaw.

Someone also created a wiki page for Mr The Cat and Mo-ha-med posted a screen shot in case the article is removed and linked it to the Facebook group!
