Featured Author: Sara Moreira Â· Global Voices
This past week I was able to catch up with Global Voices author Sara Moreira at the International School for Digital Transformation in Porto, Portugal.
Sara arrived to the program after spending several weeks in Dili, East Timor, the country whose blogosphere she dutifully covers on Global Voices.
Sara teaching young women computer engineering at East Timor National University.
She has worked as a professor at East Timor National University and was awarded computer equipment from Hewlett Packard to help introduce more Timorese women to the fields of computer engineering and web design.
Make sure not to miss Sara's three-part series commemorating the 9th anniversary of internet access in East Timor.
