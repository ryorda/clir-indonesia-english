China: Google's possible exile leads to cyber protests; Netizens on move Â· Global Voices
Do no evil, Google says.
But the irony is that it did help the Chinese government block sensitive information from the Chinese internet users, which is necessary for it to operate in China.
However, this time it seems to be really provoked and made its simmering feud with the authority public.
Google is likely to quit China.
The post on Google blog states the Google China has been suffering from cyber attacks and also, the information of its clients, many of them human rights advocates, were accessed by third party.
What is more well-known is its self-censorship.
For example, typing in words such as Tainanmen in Google.cn will never return you pictures or texts about the 1989 incident.
So, when last night Google announced it would lift the censorship, the Chinese internet users flooded to the website to search for all the sensitive terms they never had a chance to access.
In twitters, forums, discussion boards, we witness an explosion of talks about Google and its possible departure, or exile, from China.
