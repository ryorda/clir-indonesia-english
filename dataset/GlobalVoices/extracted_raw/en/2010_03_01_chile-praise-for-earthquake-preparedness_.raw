Chile: Praise for Earthquake Preparedness · Global Voices
The force exerted by the 8.8-magnitude earthquake that rattled Chile in the early morning hours of February 27 has shocked a country that is used to the earth shaking underneath their feet.
Quakes are commonplace in Chile; since 1906 and counting this most recent earthquake, Chile has experienced 28 earthquakes —without counting the smaller in magnitude but still frequent seismic activity that is often felt around the country.
The three biggest earthquakes that many Chileans can still remember left 30,000 dead in 1939, 3,000 in 1960, and 177 in 1985.
The international community together with Chileans living abroad have praised Chile’s preparedness in front of this devastating situation, which could have had an even higher casualty total.
Cory Hunt in the blog Better Now than Never wrote a post on February 28 about the earthquake in Chile.
The post begins by saying:
I have been following the events that have taken place in Chile today, as well as the subsequent tsunami warnings that have spread across the Pacific.
The Chilean government, society, and people should be praised for their readiness in dealing with such a catastrophic natural disaster…as of this writing, Chile has still not appealed for international help even though the death toll has topped 300.
