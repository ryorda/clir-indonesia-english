Paraguay: President Fernando Lugo is Removed from Office · Global Voices
As we reported earlier, the Paraguayan Senate voted to impeach President Fernando Lugo after a hasty trial.
The Paraguayan Congress had voted in favor of opening an impeachment trial triggered by his handling of a land dispute between police and campesinos ("farmers"), which left 17 people dead (seven policemen and ten farmers).
A Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) delegation traveled to Paraguay to meet with the government and the opposition who pushed the impeachment trial.
UNASUR had warned of a “camouflaged coup” and of the consequences that the President’s impeachment could bring to the country.
Today the Senate, which is controlled by the opposition, voted 39 to 4 that Fernando Lugo is guilty of poorly performing his duties, as reported by Paraguayan newspaper ABC .
Moments later, Fernando Lugo said he accepted the impeachment.
Protests immediately broke out outside Congress, denouncing this procedure as a coup d’état.
Several Twitter users reported clashes and police repression .
Netizens have been actively reacting to today’s developments.
Estela Nuñez Acosta (@Jesudi) quotes the phrase repeated by legislators who voted in favor of the impeachment, and adds:
Maybe I don't get it, but so far I have seen no proof that ‪#Lugo‬ is guilty of any of these charges.
Just politicians shouting that he is.
