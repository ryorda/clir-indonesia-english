How to Reduce the Production of CO2 in Daily Life? Â· Global Voices
Rut Abrain reflects on her blog Esturirafi about one of the main cause of climate change: the production of carbon dioxide (CO2).
In this sense, the blogger stresses out that not only factories, vehicles and planes produce CO2, but also each one of un in our daily lives.
To have an idea of the magnitude of the impact of our daily activities in the production of CO2, Rut suggests us to use this calculator.
Surprised?
Yes, each one of us has some responsibility in climate change, and at the same time, each one of us is able to reverse that with small actions.
Rut shares some advises to reduce pur production of CO2:
- Reduce, reuse and recycle.
You have to do this in all aspects of your life: avoid products with excessive packaging, purchase second hand articles, separate litter properly for further recycling.
Rut also says to reduce our "carbon footprint":
- Save energy, electricity, natural gas, domestic gas or diesel.
- Purchase local products.
- Walk, use public transportatipn.
- Use less paper.
The blogger ends up with a quote by Eduardo Galeano applicable to the impact these small actions have on reversing climate change:
Too many small people in small places, making small things, can change the world.
