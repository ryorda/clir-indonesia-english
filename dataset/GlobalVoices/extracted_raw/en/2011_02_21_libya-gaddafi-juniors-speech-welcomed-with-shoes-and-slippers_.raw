Libya: Gaddafi Junior's Speech Welcomed with Shoes and Slippers Â· Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Libya Uprising 2011.
Libyan dictator's son Saif Al Islam Al Gaddafi addressed Libyans earlier on Libyan State television, blaming everything other than his father for the massive protests and bloodshed the country has been witnessing in recent days.
He blamed Facebook, foreign mercenaries, Islamists, drug addicts and an army not trained in dealing with civilians for the carnage Libya has suffered, downplaying the number of victims and promising to stay in Libya to ensure that it isn't broken up into smaller Islamic Emirates, in order for the US not to invade it.
He also predicted doom, poverty and a bloodbath for Libyans should Gaddafi, who has ruled Libya with an iron fist for more than 40 years be toppled.
On Twitter, tweeps reacted to the speech in different ways.
Here is a snap shot of some of the reactions:
