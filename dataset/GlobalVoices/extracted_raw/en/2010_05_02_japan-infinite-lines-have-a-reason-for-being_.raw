Japan: Infinite lines have a reason for being · Global Voices
Be it for a cup of delicious ramen, a new model video game console, a donut of a popular foreign chain of sweet shops or the latest book by a bestselling novelist, some Japanese people are ready to queue!
For hours if need be in front of the shop to get what they want, whether it be a chilly rainy day in winter or a 40°C hot day of summer.
Especially, new openings are tempting.
When a new shop opens, it’s like opening a treasure chest where whoever first arrives, can lay hands on the desired object before the others and at a special price.
