Egypt: Naga Hammady Massacre · Global Voices
Respect Religions by Sarah Carr
Coptic Christians celebrate Christmas on January 7.
On the eve of their celebrations in Egypt, Copts go to churches and celebrate the holy event.
But this year an unexpected incident happened in Naga Hammady, in Upper Egypt, where an unknown criminal opened his fire randomly on people there after they finished their prayers and were on their way back to their homes.
Zeinobia wrote a new post about the massacre in her blog saying:
I am really very sorry and angry for what happened in Naj Hammadi yesterday.
It hurts me more than the Egyptian Christians because what happened is against all Egyptians.
...
My condolences to the families of those who were killed and injured in this disgusting attack.
Another blog, Coptic File, wrote about the incident: A shooting gun was used from inside a car (green Fiat), to randomly kill eight people and many others were wounded.
They all were from those who attended the prayers that took place in the church on the Christmas eve.
On Misr Digital, Wael Abbas also published a video of Naga Hammay shootout on his blog.
The ministry of interior says that this attack is related to an older incident when a 12-year-old Muslim girl was raped by a Christian man in the same city.
But Zeinobia can't see how such incident can be accepted as an excuse for the shooting.
She also blames the ministry of interior for the whole thing:
And with my all respect this is ridiculous , fighting a crime by a group of crimes.
I blame the ministry of interior in all of this , if there is a real respect and fear of the law nothing of this could happen.
Also, Nawara shares echoes similar sentiments.
On the Ministry of Interior's press release regarding the shooting, she says: The strangest release I've ever read in my entire life, I've never seen a press release blaming the victims and encouraging mass punishment.
Nawara also blamed the Egyptian Media: The inactive Egyptian media is ignoring the incident, as if the ones who were killed yesterday are sheep.
The Cat of the Desert blamed the society and the extremists for all this. سرقوا فرحتهم بالعيد وقتلوهم برصاص الإرهاب والغدر .. وقاعدين لحد يولولوا على شهيدة المرجيحة اللى اطلقوا عليها شهيدة الحجاب
مستنيين ايه ؟؟ بعد الانحطاط وقلة الادب على المختلف عقائديا مستنين سمعتكو تبقى ايه فى الخارج ؟؟
الله ينتقم من كل من افتى بتكفير الآخرين وعلى رأسهم القرضاوى والحيوانى وحسان Seven young Christian children were killed, and many others were wounded.
They stole their Christmas celebrations and happiness, and killed them with their bullets.
And they are still crying on the the martyr of the sea-saw, and they called her the martyr of the hijab.
What are you waiting for after all this ignorance, and retardation?
What are you expecting the others to think of us after this?
God damn those who call for considering the others infidels, and on top of the the Al Quaradawy, El Huwainy, and Hassaaan.
He then posted a video of Abu Is-haq El Huwainy warning people form the Christians and the evil plots they make against Egypt!
The Egyptian blogger, Te3ma, on the other hand, believes that some foreign entities stand behind such incidents: I'm so sure that the ones behind this massacre are from outside, and not from here.
