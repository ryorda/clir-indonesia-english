Madagascar: Rumors terrorize Antananarivo · Global Voices
Truth and freedom of speech and opinion seem to be victims of the political crisis that is now crippling Madagascar.
Threats are being made and rumors being spread, all contributing to a climate of terror that prohibits peace and normal life.
Jentilisa, a blogger who has not given his support to Andry Rajoelina's protest movement, reports receiving threats:
"for more restraint and to stop the hatred, incitement, rumors and misinformation in their news items and editorial line."
Some journalists have been heard inciting mobs to hatred on various radio stations, especially the TGV VIVA radio station.
Journalists have shamelessly designated some individuals as "Enemies of the People", while giving information on their homes and license plate numbers on the radio.
These "Enemies of the People" are then targeted by mobs and their homes are burned down or looted.
"Finally! the incumbent speaks up and his people show Madagascar and the world that they are not interested in a new government being forced upon them.
I was really starting to wonder what Ravalomana could do.
I hope this is the beginning of a realisation for the Malagasy people… Wouldn’t that be great?
There was about 30,000 people inside of the arena and about 10,000 outside of the arena, all standing in the rain supporting their country and democracy.
Most inside where shouting “Arrest TGV!” repeatedly (which is not a bad idea) and carrying around banners that say “Tsy Mila TGV” (We dont need TGV)!"
Singers were invited to perform, among them Samoela, whose song "President" seems now prescient in describing this power struggle:
"Unconfirmed reports claim that Andry TGV told the crowd that President Ravalomanana left the country."
Rumors on protesters of both camps being bribed:
"I think people here just want to live in peace.
They want to go to work or to school without the fear of being trapped in riots, or taken by force to join those who are on strike.
Shop owners want to open their businesses and be sure that no one will loot and burn them.
We are fed up with this feeling of permanent insecurity.The last protest didn’t draw as many followers as before still people are wary because nothing is sure yet.
Even though we are back to our daily life we don’t know what will happen tomorrow."
