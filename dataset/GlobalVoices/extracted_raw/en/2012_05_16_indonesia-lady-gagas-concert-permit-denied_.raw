Lady Gaga fans, who were called 'little monsters', have criticized the government's decision:
@akibaryou: Save Mother Monster!
Save the freedom of expression!
The cancellation is proof of how our country has lost its priority.#IndonesiaSavesGaga!
@Ray_owl: FPI is embarrassing Indonesia internationally! #IndonesiaSavesGaga RT @lanaaisya: FPI is being a hypocrite. #saveladygaga
@danielvk: Religious mafia manipulates democracy & freedom to rob the freedom of others.
Don't tolerate intolerance! #saynotohate #indonesiasavesgaga
@DanielZiv: It's not a matter of #IndonesiaSavesGaga, it's more like whether Gaga can save Indonesia.And really, Indonesia needs to save itself from this extremist nonsense, Gaga or no Gaga.
