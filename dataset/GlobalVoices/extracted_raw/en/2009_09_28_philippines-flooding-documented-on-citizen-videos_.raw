Philippines: Flooding documented on citizen videos · Global Voices

Several parts of Metro Manila and nearby provinces are still flooded today even if Tropical Storm ‘Ondoy’ (International name: Ketsana) has already left the country.
Almost 200 were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced when the storm hit the country’s capital last Saturday.
The heavy rainfall triggered the worst flooding in the country in recent memory.
The storm even dumped more rains than Hurricane Katrina:
RT @wizkitabet: FACT: Hurricane Katrina rainfall =380mm in Louisiana.
Typhoon Ondoy rainfall = 410mm in Manila, Philippines.
Social media sites were maximized to inform rescuers about the location of flood victims.
Typhoon Ondoy Situation Map was created to compile information about the needs of the flood victims.
Google has created a special page to gather donations.
Ondoy Relief Efforts has a comprehensive list of contact details of relief agencies, donation drop-off centers, and government emergency response teams.

Citizen videos were uploaded on cyberspace which captured horrible scenes of loss brought by the flooding.
Below is a video by Youtube user didipusrex
My mother was able to take a video clip of the floodwaters of Typhoon Ondoy before the water surge forced them to flee to the second floor.
They were trapped in chest deep water on the second floor until the waters subsided the next morning.
This video shows a passenger who was trapped in a car while a strong floodwater was rampaging outside a Manila hospital
Marikina City, located east of Manila, was heavily devastated by the floods
Pedestrians and even motorists in Paranaque City, south of Manila, use styrofoam to cross a flooded street
Cars are swept away by strong flood currents
Bulacan province, north of Manila, was also severely affected by the storm
Techpinas praises a radio station for devoting its program to update listeners about the storm.
Many of its listeners were flood victims who relied on their cell phone radio for relief updates:
In the midst of uncertainty and suffering brought about by Ondoy and the lack of electricity in most parts of Mega Manila, DJ Gang, DJ Lambert and DJ Steph selflessly gave their time and effort into making sure that cellphone owners - especially those stuck in disaster stricken areas, whose only access to news was their dying cellphones' FM radio app - were kept updated on the status of relief operations and were somehow kept alive by Jam 88.3's display of resilient and pro-active hope.
They practically turned the usually indifferent FM radio scene into a venue for disaster relief info dissemination and volunteer coordination.
Texting was used to advise flood victims on how to survive
What was truly heartening is the public's involvement in Jam's efforts.
There were those who called the station to give updates on the traffic situation across the metro.
Doctors texted to give tips to those staying on the roofs of their flood-engulfed houses on how to avoid hypothermia, while a former red cross volunteer shared the procedure on how to prepare an oral rehydration solution
