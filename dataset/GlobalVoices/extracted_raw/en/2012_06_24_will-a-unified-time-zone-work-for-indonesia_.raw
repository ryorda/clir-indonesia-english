Will a Unified Time Zone Work for Indonesia? Â· Global Voices
Indonesia, the world's largest archipelagic country, plans to synchronize its three time zones in October 2012.
The business sector, especially travel operators, applauded the plan saying that synchronized time with Asia's financial capitals such as Seoul, Hongkong and Singapore would boost business activities and tourism.
However, former Vice President Jusuf Kalla said that the plan is 'illogical' while the Indonesian Council of Ullemas (MUI) said that change will confuse religious believers.
According to blogger Rusrian Yuzaf, the time change will influence people's habits including prayer habits of Indonesian Muslims:
