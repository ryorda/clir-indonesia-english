The streets in Bangladesh's capital are turning into open buffets for iftar, the sunset meal during the Islamic month of fasting Ramzan, or Ramadan as it is called in Arabic.
More than 90 per cent of Bangladesh's population is Muslim.
So it is no surprise that in Ramzan — when Muslims refrain from food, drink, and sex from sunrise to sunset — the culture around food in the country transforms.
From restaurants in luxurious hotels to small street vendors, everyone has a special menu and lay-out during this month.
On the road side, sizzling iftar items are transferred from open air stoves to street-side displays, as vendors call out to customers.
According to historians, some of Dhaka's "shahi" or royal iftar foods date back to the sixteenth century, when Dhaka was part of the Mughal empire.

Blogger Boka Manush Bolte Chai writes:
In the sixteenth century the Mughal empire expanded its reign to Dhaka.
When they first built a camp in Dhaka, they brought their own cooking team.
Mughals cherished their comfort and led a luxurious lifestyle.
Their culinart art was one of the important parts of their way of life.
Their cooks used extravagant spices and excess oil to make the food delicious.
To keep pace with the luxury of living of the Mughal families their own employed waiters and cooks were not enough and so they hired many local people to serve them.
Some of them were trained in the Mughal culinary arts.
Through these cook, Mughal cuisine spread in Dhaka city outside of the palaces.

The Iftar is not only limited to family feasts in Bangladesh.
It also helps build community bonds.
The caption below says, "Buddhist monks are serving food (Iftar) to hundreds of poor Muslims during Ramadan.
This is an example of social harmony between religions in Bangladesh."
In Bangladesh, a wide variety of foods is prepared to break the fast at Maghrib (evening prayer) time.
Some of the common iftar items from Bangladeshi cuisine include Piyaji (made of lentils paste, chopped onions, green chilies, like falafel), Beguni (made of thin slices of eggplant dipped in a thin batter of gram flour), Jilapi, Muri ( puffed rice similar to Rice Krispies ) , yellow lentil grains, usually soaked in water and spiced with onion, garlic, chilli and other iftar items), Haleem, dates, samosas, Dal Puri (a type of lentil based savoury pastry), Chola (cooked chickpeas), fish kabab, mughlai paratha (stuffed fried bread with minced meat and spices), pitha, traditional Bengali sweets and different types of fruits such as watermelon.
Drinks such as Rooh Afza and lemon sharbat are common on iftar tables across the country.
People like to have iftar at home with all family members and iftar parties are also arranged by mosques.
Blogger Mohammad Ilius Chawdhury writes about the rush at a mall during iftar time in Somewhereinblog:
Half an hour before iftar time I reached the food court level.
It was so crowded.
All the seats were booked.
Even corridors, narrow walking lanes and section of the floor were blocked by people waiting for Iftar.
There was no way to get pass them to some Iftar from the food court
