This post is part of our special coverage Yemen Protests 2011.
Thousands of protesters have gathered in Change Square, in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, to call on President Ali Abdulla Saleh to step down.
The protests are going strong in what is being described as The Friday of Departure and the army has reportedly fired gunshots in the air to stop pro-regime protesters from clashing with pro-democracy demonstrators.

Last Friday was the bloodiest since anti-Saleh protests started in Yemen more than two months ago.
Here are the latest reactions from Twitter:
