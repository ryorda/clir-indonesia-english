Iraq: Organised 'crackdown' on homosexuals · Global Voices
In the past few weeks there has been an increase in the persecution of homosexuals in Iraq, due to an organised 'crackdown' based on a religious decree for their death, reports UAE- based media network alarabiya.net.
There has been a spate of deaths resulting from a previously unheard of and particularly gruesome torture method being employed against homosexual men.
Iraqi human rights activist Yina Mohammad told alarabiya.net that:
Homosexuality is largely frowned upon across Iraqi society and it seems that sympathy for their deteriorating plight is non-existent.
Gay people are perceived as violating social norms and threatening the society with “moral decay.”
An eyewitness who saw an attack against a young man said: “The dog got what he deserved.”
This perception has legitimatized attacks on them.
According to Iraqi law all breaches of social or religious custom can only be dealt with by the judiciary.
There is no room for religious law and yet since 2006 militias have been attacking gay people with the religious backing of a number of Islamic clerics.
In light of the current situation, the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) sent a letter last month to the Iraqi Minister of Human Rights, Wijdan Salim, requesting specific measures be taken to protect LGBT Iraqis against hate crimes and persecution.
The letter can be seen here.
According to the IGLHRC many of the attacks against homosexuals do not receive proper investigation, and the perpetrators too often go without punishment.
There have also been reports coming from alarabiya.net and the blogs that some homosexuals are denied treatment when seeking help at hospitals.
It is clear that some kind of change needs to take place to counter the rise in such atrocities.
While foreign support groups and outside pressure have positive impact, for the gay Iraqi living in fear, these groups have little effect on their daily struggle.
In Shams Al-Ma7aba, a couple writing from Bahrain, sum up the frustration experienced by homosexuals deprived of their basic rights:
