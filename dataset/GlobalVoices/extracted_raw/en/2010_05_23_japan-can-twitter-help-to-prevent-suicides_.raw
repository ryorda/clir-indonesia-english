Japan: Can Twitter help to prevent suicides? Â· Global Voices
Blue LED lights at Shinjuku St.(Tokyo) By jediduke The National Police Agency has recently released the results of its annual survey on suicide in Japan.
According to the official statistics , 32,845 people committed suicide last year and dramatic is the increase in number of victims in their 20s and 30s; the main reasons are said to be 1) health problems, 2) economic and social problems, 3) family problems.
Sadly known as one of the developed countries with one of the highest per capita number of suicides , Japan has been trying for years to confront the problem, by working to tackle it at all levels of society.
The government and other groups constantly launch campaigns to raise awareness and invite people to turn to assistance centers whenever they feel depressed or convinced that the only way to solve their, or often their loved ones, problems is to commit suicide.
Deciding to talk to somebody, reflecting and defining the causes of their desperation, is a very hard step that few people in a state of depression are believed to be able to make.
But, although it cannot represent a definitive solution, some believe that the internet might be a tool to help, especially among the tech-savvy, younger generations.
To this regard, Twitter has been recently a subject of debate of those who see in its 140 word format a potential for contact with those who seek help but prefer to remain anonymous and cannot express their suffering in long and well articulated phrases.
Yamabe says that the news that actress Demi Moore reportedly prevented a woman from committing suicide by tweeting a 16-word-long comment recently made him reflect on the question.
