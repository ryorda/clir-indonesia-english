The Greatest Street Party on Earth: The Brazilian Carnival · Global Voices
A week ago today, Brazilians were waking up to enjoy the country's most celebrated annual festival: the Carnival, or rather, the biggest extravaganza on Earth that draws millions of people onto the streets of the many cities all over the country.
It is one of many European imports that having mixed Native, African and European elements, have found their own flavor, colours and fame in Brazil.
Nevermind the worldwide economic crisis, or Brazil's own everyday crises – it is carnival as usual.
The numbers for domestic and international tourism were above expectations and higher than last year's, following the trend for yearly growth.
It was expected that 719,000 international tourists would visit Rio de Janeiro alone (last year, there were 705,000).
And with the dollar on a high, many of the Brazilians who would normally spend their holidays abroad decided to have a carnival at home, traveling within the country.
During Carnival, people dress up, indulge themselves or just take the always welcomed opportunity of time off to recharge batteries.
The country grinds to a halt during the celebration, and many say the new year only begins after carnival.
It is impossible not to laugh at people's creativity when it comes to making costumes with a pinch of irreverence, sense of humour and an eye for local and international current affairs.

During Carnival, authorities give out millions of condoms, but still, a baby boom is always expected nine months after.

No pancake day in Brazil, the last day of Carnival is melancholy - early hours, Rio de Janeiro.
