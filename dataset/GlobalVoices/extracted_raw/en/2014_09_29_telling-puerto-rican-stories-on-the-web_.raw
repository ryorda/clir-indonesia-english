Telling Puerto Rican Stories on the Web · Global Voices
Esta Vida Boricua is a digital storytelling project which explores the past and present of Puerto Rico through the collection of experiences of people from all walks of life and all ages.
At its most basic level, it is "a place to share stories," as explained in their "About" section.
Elaborating on that thought, they write:
Thus, the stories herein are a journey.
They offer splashes of color and texture, shades of shadow and light as well as fragments of shape and depth to the existing Puerto Rican mosaic.
They unravel the stereotypes and biased images of Puerto Rico and Puerto Rican culture presented in the media and beyond.
They speak of a generation of young people struggling under the uncertainty of colonialism —and a backlash from the slow cultural genocide that has taken place since US occupation after the Spanish-American War and the advent of modernism.
The content, which can take the form of writing (in either Spanish or English), video or audio recordings, is entirely produced by volunteers, most of whom are students from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez, on the western coast of the main island.
Poets, musicians and writers are also welcome to contribute original content.
