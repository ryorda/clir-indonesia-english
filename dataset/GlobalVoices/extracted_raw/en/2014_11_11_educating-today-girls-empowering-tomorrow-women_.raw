Educating Girls Today, Empowering Women Tomorrow · Global Voices
Marita Seara, who blogs for Voces Visibles (Visibles voices), invites us to reflect on the discrimination that affects girls and teenagers — access to education — and the need of educating our girls today so they can be the empowered women of the future.

According to data backed up by Amenisty International, 41 million girls can't even access elementary education.
Illiteracy, child marriage, teen pregnancy are part of a vicious cycle that especially affects our girls.
Thus, Latina America isn't exempted from this global issue, mainly about teen pregnancy:
Venezuela is top of the list in South America and third place in Latin America with the highest rate of early pregnancy.
Out of 100 Venezuelan women that get pregnant each year, 25 are teenagers, according to Telemedicine program at the Central University of Venezuela.
Among the causes of teen pregnancy, it's worth mentioning that one-third of unwanted pregnancies are a result of not using protection, and half of the girls affected didn't receive proper sexual and reproductive education before getting pregnant.
So, education is the only way.
By educating our girls today, we are empowering women of tomorrow, and therefore, their families and communities.
