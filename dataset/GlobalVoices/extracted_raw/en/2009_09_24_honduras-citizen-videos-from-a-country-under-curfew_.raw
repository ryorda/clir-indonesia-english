Honduras: Citizen Videos from a Country Under Curfew · Global Voices
Three months after Honduran President Mel Zelaya was ousted in a coup that some Hondurans claim was justified and others insist was illegal, he returned to Honduras on September 21 seeking refuge in the Brazilian Embassy in the capital city, Tegucigalpa.
Zelaya's return has led to an escalation of the political tension and division in the streets of Honduras, leaving citizens frightened, and lacking food as a compulsory nationwide curfew was imposed by Roberto Micheletti's interim government
In cities across the country, Zelaya supporters ignored the curfews and staged protests, in spite of the warnings of the interim government and police.
As a result, police and Zelaya supporters clashed and there have been reports of casualties, as well as approximately 100 arrests .
The curfew was temporarily halted between the hours of 10 am and 4 pm on September 23 and allowed Hondurans to replenish supplies.
Aaron Ortiz of Pensieve writes:
Most people were at work when Zelaya announced his return and were unable to prepare for a days-long curfew.
Expect incredibly long lines, “venta loca” (mad sales) at the markets and bare counters at supermarkets everywhere, as millions of Hondurans rush to stockpile on food, candles, diesel, and other goods
