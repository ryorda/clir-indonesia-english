Guatemala: Collaborative Publishing of the Book TRANS 2.0 · Global Voices
In celebration of World Book Day, Guatemalan author and blogger Julio Serrano asked 50 of his friends and readers to publish different parts of his book TRANS 2.0 on their blogs.
This new publishing project brings together enthusiasts of literature from all over the world to participate in this open license initiative.
The book's site , which still has a temporary design, contains links to all of the participating bloggers.
Serrano, who also directs another open book project called Libros Minimos , received collaboration from other well-known authors like Javier Payeras of El Intruso and Denise P.P. of La Maleta .
Many of the bloggers included photographs or illustrations that they felt best complemented the text included on their sites.
Other fragments of the book can be found on blogs such as Notas Poco Rigurosas , which is hosting a poem called "The Center of America is a long asphalt road", while Fe de Rata shares with his readers "Marta Julia is the name of the Cascabel snake at the park" and is accompanied by a handmade drawing.
The blog Noticias para Dios is hosting a poem about a taxicab and prefers to illustrate it using a photograph of a woman sleeping in a car.
Diario Paranoico offers his space to publish "No, life is not this" adding music in the form of a Sui Generis video.
