An ariel view of demonstrators gathering in Ramsis by @basboussa1As the gatherings get bigger, some find it difficult to catch up.
Ahmad Khalil tweets: عشرون الف متظاهر فى شارع جامعة الدول العربيةشباب وصبايا وربات بيوت واطفال يركدون لم استط محارتهم ...نفسى اتقطع 20,000 demonstrators on the Arab League Road.
Young people, housewives and children.
They are all running.
I wasn't able to catch up with them.
I lost my breath
In another tweet, he sums up the mood: الناس اللى ماشيين فى المظاهرة اول مرة اشوفهم ..يظهر اول مرة يتظاهروا كلهم همة وحماس عايزين يعملوا ثورة حقيقية This is the first time I see those people in this demonstration.
It seems that this is the first time for them to demonstrate.
They are full of enthusiasm and excitement - as if they want to create a real revolution
Soon enough, tweets of police repression start pouring in.

Took their ids and phone.
We barely got out." #jan25

And in another tweet says: اخبار عن ضرب المتظاهرين في شبرا News of protesters being beaten up in Shubra
Crowdmap to report demonstration updatesA crowdmap, prepared by the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, is already in place for people to report the protests, arrests, police harassment and where people and police are gathering.
And in an expected or not so expected move, reports are also surfacing of the censoring of internet sites.

Now http://dostor.org and Bambuser.com are blocked in Egypt #NetFreedom #Jan25
And Alaa Abd El Fattah tweets:
Egyptian ISPs seem to be illegally blocking websites again, collaborating with police despite no laws allowing internet censorship #jan25
Meanwhile, Mona Eltahawy notes:
In past 8 days at least 12 #Egyptians set themselves on fire out of desperation: unemployment, poverty, corruption. #Jan25 #Egypt protest
