Peru: Air Force Officer Charged with Spying for Chile · Global Voices
On November 12th, news broke that Victor Ariza Mendoza, a member of the Peruvian Air Force was taken into custody for the alleged spying for Chile within the Peruvian Armed Forces.
This incident, which takes place during the ongoing tense relationship with its southern neighbor, caused Peruvian President Alan García to cancel a meeting with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting being held in Singapore, as well as his subsequent return to Peru to evaluate the situation.
In addition, the Peruvian Ambassador in Santiago was called back to Peru for consultation, and the Prime Minister requested that the Production Minister, Mercedes Aráoz suspend her planned trip to Chile.
The official Chilean response has been a denial that it had anything to do with the matter, first regretting the incident, and then saying that Peru's reaction was hasty .
A Chilean deputy stated that due to "Peru's constant aggressive attitude" that "it should serve so that we do not continue to turn the other cheek to Peru."
Some of the Chilean press has been calling this one of the worst crises between the two countries .
Tensions between the two countries comes at a time when Peru is pushing for disarmament in the region .
The scheduled trip by Minister Aráoz was to discuss the initiative in Chile.
General Ricardo Ortega, head of the Chilean Armed Forces stated that "it is no coincidence" that the spy's arrest took place just when the United States announced that they would authorize Chile to purchase additional missiles.
He adds that the Peruvian government has "an interest in provoking" the Chilean government.
