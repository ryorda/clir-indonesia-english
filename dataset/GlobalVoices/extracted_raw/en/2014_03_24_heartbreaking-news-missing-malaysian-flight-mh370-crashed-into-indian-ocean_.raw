Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib Razak announced Monday evening that missing airliner MH370 has crashed into the Indian Ocean based on the latest analysis of satellite data:
...its last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth.
This is a remote location, far from any possible landing sites.
It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.
MH370 went missing on March 8 during its flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
There are still no conclusive information as to why the plane lost contact but authorities said its radar was deliberately turned off.
There were 239 passengers and crew members onboard MH370.
For two weeks, the world intently waited for updates on the search for the missing plane.
Malaysia Airlines posted this message moments before the Prime Minister made his announcement:
Malaysia Airlines deeply regrets that we have to assume that MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.
On behalf of all of us at Malaysia Airlines and all Malaysians, our prayers go out to all the loved ones of the 226 passengers and of our 13 friends and colleagues at this enormously painful time.
We know there are no words that we or anyone else can say which can ease your pain.
We will continue to provide assistance and support to you, as we have done since MH370 first disappeared in the early hours of 8 March, while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
Netizens around the world used the hashtags #PrayforMH370 and #RIPMH370 to send their condolences to the families of the passengers and crew members of MH370:
In this very difficult time, we hope the families stay strong and hold on despite all odds.
