How School Lunch Plays a Central Role in Education in Japan · Global Voices
As anyone who has ever attended or taught at a Japanese school can tell you, school lunch (給食, kyuushoku) is the most important part of the day.
It provides not only nourishment, but also an opportunity to teachers and students to bond by eating together.
While the lunch is typically prepared by full-time staff in a large kitchen either in the school or at a central facility that serves the entire school district, it's the students who are responsible for serving lunch for their classmates.
New York-based Cafeteria Culture (CafCu), which has a mission to work creatively to achieve zero-waste public school cafeterias and climate-smart communities, has produced an engaging informative video that provides great insights about how school lunches are a fundamental part of learning in Japan's schools.
