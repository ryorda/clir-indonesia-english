Chile: Army Deployed to Streets of Concepción · Global Voices
As the third day after the devastating 8.8-magnitude quake came to an end, the situation in Concepción, Chile’s second largest city, had worsened considerably since Sunday.
Confirmed reports of uncontrolled looting, building collapses, violence, and even in some cases, arson led to the deployment of a strong contingent of 4,500 soldiers to the city.

The deployment of the army occurs at a time when regional authorities had begun to point fingers at the national government of President Michelle Bachelet for not sending the army earlier.
Currently, citizen and mass media outlets in Chile report that Concepcion is experiencing a shortage of food and water .
The city has no electricity and its water supply is intermittent .
Apart from these complications, several buildings have collapsed throughout the city .
Perhaps the most dramatic and devastating collapse that occurred was that of a 15-story building, where survivors are still thought to be trapped under the rubble.
