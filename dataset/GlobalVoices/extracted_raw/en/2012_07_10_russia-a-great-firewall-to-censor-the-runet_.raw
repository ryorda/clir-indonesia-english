Russia: A Great Firewall to Censor the RuNet? Â· Global Voices
Earlier today, the Russian language section of Wikipedia repeated past protests against American and Italian Internet laws by shutting down its service and posting in the place of its main portal a public announcement condemning a draft law now under review by the Russian parliament.
Law 89417-6 , "On the Protection of Children From Information Harmful to Their Health and Development," entered the Duma in early June with endorsements from members of all four of the represented political parties, but has since generated rising controversy, with critics portraying the legislation as an attempt to copy China's "Great Firewall."

Text reads: "Imagine a world without free knowledge."
What Would the Law Do?
The law would create a registry (or "blacklist") of any online materials containing illegal information relevant to children (specifically child pornography, drug paraphernalia, and instructions about self-harm).
Once a website appeared on the list, the site's hosting-provider would have 24 hours to notify the site-owner, who must then delete the offending data.
If the owner fails to act, the hosting-provider is required to shut down or delete the site itself.
In the event that the hosting-provider fails or refuses to act, it joins the registry and then web-providers must cut off access to that entire hosting-provider.
Anyone included on the blacklist then has three months to appeal the decision in court.
The draft law owes its origins to the "League for a Safe Internet" , which prepared a blueprint for the Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications this past spring.
At that stage, the plan was to limit the registry to URLs (excluding DNS filtering and IP blocking), and delegate authority over managing the list to a non-governmental organization.
The League's director, Denis Davydov, explained that concerns about Internet society's fear of "excessive state control" motivated this design.
Duma deputies and the General Prosecutor, however , had other plans, and the registry's reach was expanded, and the likely candidate for oversight is now Roskomnadzor (the Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications).
Much of the controversy surrounding Law 89417-6 focuses on worries that its language is intentionally vague, opening the door to future expansions of the registry's application.
For instance, lawyer Evgeny Arievich, a partner at Baker and McKenzie, says that the blacklist could grow to include other types of information illegal under other criminal codes (such as those governing extremism, state secrets, personal data, and so on), and that it could be used to limit access to political information and social mobilization tools.
The most sensitive section of the law seems to be Article 5, Point 4, Sections 1 and 2, where the bill delineates what online information can be added to the registry without a court order and what requires judicial approval.
The following materials (pulled from the draft law after its first reading ) fall within the former category:
