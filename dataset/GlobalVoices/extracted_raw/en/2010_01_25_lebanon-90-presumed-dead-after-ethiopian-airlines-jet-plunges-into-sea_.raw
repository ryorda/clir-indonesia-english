Lebanon: too many TV Stations= too much airtime #et409 #coverage switching into sensational and fictional mode #fail

Lebanese media has no decency or any sense of ethics, they're already referring to the missing ppl as "dead" #ET409 #Lebanon

LBC (Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation) analysis of the #ET409 is very stupid and wrongful #fail
