After weeks of speculation, Saudi Arabia today announced the death of King Abdulla bin Abdulaziz, 90, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
Abdulla came to power in August 2005, after the death of his half-brother Fahad bin Abdulaziz, and is now succeeded by his other brother Salman bin Abdulaziz, who is 79.
And their other brother Muqrin has been named Crown Prince.
They are all the sons of King Abdulaziz, who founded Saudi Arabia in 1932, and have been ascending the throne in succession over the years.
Abdulaziz had 45 sons of whom 36 survived to adulthood and had children of their own.

Online, citizens of the world were quick to share their two cents.
Saudi blogger Ahmed Al Omran notes how the now King Salman's bio on Twitter has changed to reflect his new position:

There was also a confusion about the deceased King and his new successor's ages.
From the UAE, Abdulkhaleq Abdulla tweeted:
Just in.

And many were not kind to news of Abdulla's dead.
