Ukraine: "Stalin" Tea Sparks Controversy Â· Global Voices
According to a recent poll , up to 46 percent of Ukrainians feel nostalgic for the USSR, most of them being pensioners, as well as residents of Eastern and Southern regions of the country.
At the same time, only 18% of Western Ukrainians and 19 percent of young people share this sentiment.
Such blurred attitudes toward the recent communist past are being eagerly exploited by manufacturers, who have been using Soviet symbols to market their goods for years.
Nevertheless, the recent promotion of a domestically-produced tea named after the notorious Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin has sparked a heated discussion among Ukrainian netizens, many of whom felt that this time marketers have overstepped the line.
In February, Dnipropetrovsk city Internet forum user Vtoroy shared several photos of a billboard advertising the "Stalin" tea.
