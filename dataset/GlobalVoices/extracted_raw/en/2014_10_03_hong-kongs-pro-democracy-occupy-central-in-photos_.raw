Peaceful protests demanding free elections in Hong Kong have entered their sixth day.
Hong Kongers are calling on Beijing to allow the people to nominate the candidates themselves in city's next chief executive election.
China has said it will allow Hong Kong, a special administrative region that enjoys a certain amount of autonomy from the mainland, a direct vote in 2017 for the first time, but has ruled that a largely pro-Beijing nominating committee select the candidates before they are allowed on the ballot.
Protesters are also pushing for current Chief Executive CY Leung, who has refused to back down but has agreed to hold talks with the movement, to resign.
Occupy Central, as the sit-in in central Hong Kong is called, attracted tens of thousands of people at its peak.
Footage from a drone, vetted by Storyful, captured just how far the protest stretched on September 29:
The rally has so far stood its ground against police attempts to clear the area with tear gas, pepper spray and batons.
Protesters have used umbrellas to shield themselves from the aggressive tactics, leading some to call the movement the "umbrella revolution" or "umbrella uprising."
Take a look at photos below for a further glimpse of Occupy Central.
