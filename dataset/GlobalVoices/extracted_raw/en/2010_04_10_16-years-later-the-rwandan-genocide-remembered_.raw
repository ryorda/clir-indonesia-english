16 Years Later, the Rwandan Genocide Remembered · Global Voices
On April 7th, Rwanda commemorated the 16th anniversary of the genocide that took the lives of as many as 800,000 people and traumatized a whole region to this day.
The genocide is commemorated to keep the memory of the victims alive and honor them but also to help the country move forward in the spirit of unity and reconciliation.
Survivors of the genocide recall those 100 days when humanity as a whole failed them immensely and consistently.
Many of them are involved in the reconstruction process, creating networks to sustain coexistence.
In the aftermath of French president Sarkozy recent visit to Kigali and acknowledging in a joint press conference with President Kagame that "mistakes were made" in 1994 (fr), bloggers discuss the meaning of Genocide Memorial Day (although commemorations really last a week) and the complexity of Rwanda's international relations.
Tutsi survivor Norah Bagarinka recalls how she was stopped by militiamen but was eventually saved by one of them who happened to be her gardener:
He took us, my other and three other ladies, aside on the other bush.
When we reached there, he got some leaves, bandaged my hand, and he told us: " Run, run for your safety".
And he apologized.
The project Voices of Rwanda records the life stories of Rwandans - not just stories about the genocide, but about their lives as whole.
This testimony from a survivors explain why she feels compelled to remember and provide her testimony:
" If I die without telling my story here, my lineage will be snuffed out"

Blogger Mamadou Kouyate posts an article on the recollection of a group of Australian soldiers from the UN peacekeeping team of the Kibeho massacre:
"Many of the vets have a lot of guilt about what happened because they were not able to do the best they could do to save lives.
They could not do anything to defend those who couldn't defend themselves."
"All that seemed to remain was the stench of genocide and children abandoned by war pathetically wandering the streets, traumatised by the death and destruction they had witnessed."
The commemoration in Amohoro (Peace) Stadium were followed by 20,000 people in a calm and uplifting atmosphere.
Sara Strawczynski provides a description of the Walk to Remember in the streets of Kigali:
During my months living and working as a Kiva Fellow in Rwanda, I’ve had a hard time reconciling what I know to have taken place with what I experience day-to-day.
Kigali is a safe, clean and beautiful city.
The countryside is lush and stunning.
That said, signs of Rwanda’s genocide are never far beneath the surface we passed two groups of prisoners, easily identifiable in their pink, orange and blue jumpsuits.
Rwanda’s prisons are filled with people accused and convicted of genocide and war crimes, and its incarceration rate is among the highest in the world.
Jenny Clover attended a commemoration at the Church of Nyamata where 10,000 people were killed:
The church at Nyamata is filled with the clothes of all 10,000 people who died there – thousands and thousands of shirts, dresses, socks and trousers piled on church pews.
They start to blur into one after a while – just a muddy pile of tatty clothes, pulled from a mass grave where the murderers tried to cover up what they had done.
There's a lot more to say about the memorial at Nyamata: the rows and rows of skulls neatly lined up in the cold underground crypt, some with clean machete cuts right though them..
This is the second time that Jina Moore is in Rwanda during Memorial Day.
She is torn between "the obligation to attend and the urge to stay away":
Many are marking something they know from memory; others are remembering the loss of family, even if they were abroad and did not face genocide themselves.
But this is not my memory.
Without a doubt, I will spend the better part of today thinking of my friends who are survivors, and thinking of the family they lost who, through my friends' stories, feel almost like people I knew, too.
Perhaps I will mark some part of the day with those friends.
Perhaps not.
There is often discussion among the mzungus here of whether it's intrusive of us to go to these programs, or on the other hand whether it's disrespectful not to.
I don't think there's a rule.
Many local bloggers have also reacted to the complex relations between Rwanda and the international community.
Stephane Ballong explains that the relation between Rwanda and France is still a bit tense (fr):
