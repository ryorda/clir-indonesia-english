Americas: Looking Forward to Central America Free Software Festival · Global Voices
The Central American Free Software Festival (ECSL09 for its initials in Spanish) will take place on June 17-21 in Estelí, Nicaragua.
This will be the first opportunity for many enthusiasts of open-source and free software from across Central America to come together to share experiences, promote their projects, establish common objectives, and to find ways to work together.
The schedule of events includes workshops and panels where different members from communities will lead and participate in these activities.
There will also be a "rapid-development" tournament, where participants will need to design and program an application in a short period of time, with the only stipulations are that it must be developed using free tools and available under a free license.

Estelí is a city in northern Nicaragua, near to the border of Honduras, 150 kms. from capital city Managua, and the official venue of the First Central American Free Software Summit.
The city of Estelí, known as the Diamond of the Segovias, will also host the first international meeting of Ubuntu community leaders in Central America, with the participation of members from the Ubuntu Local Community Teams in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Panamá, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and special guests from other communities in Latin America.
