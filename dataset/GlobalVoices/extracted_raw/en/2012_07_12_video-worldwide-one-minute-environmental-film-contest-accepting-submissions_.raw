To participate, choose one of the 5 categories related to environmental awareness such as oceans, recycling, women and climate change, fresh water, and sustainable living.
Using their form, send in your pitch for what you'd like your 1 minute video to be before September 5, 2012.
A jury will select 10 proposals (two from each category) who will then be able to receive funds to make their one minute film.
Those 10 films will compete for the grand prize, and the one with more views for each category will win.
Full information on how to participate can be found on the tve biomovies 2012 guidelines, pitches can be made in Arabic, English, German, Russian or Spanish.
