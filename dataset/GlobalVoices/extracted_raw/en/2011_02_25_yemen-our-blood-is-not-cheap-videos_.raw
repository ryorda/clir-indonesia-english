Yemen: "Our blood is not cheap" (Videos) Â· Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Yemen Protests 2011.
Tens of thousands of protesters across Yemen rallied for and against President Ali Abdullah Saleh after Friday prayers.
Two protesters were shot dead in Yemen's second-largest city Aden on Friday, February 25, in what appears to be confrontations between anti-Saleh groups and police.
At least 34 others have been wounded, most by live gunfire.
In the Yemen's capital Sanaa, people were especially worried about rivaling demonstrations scheduled for Friday, but no major incidents were reported.
Around 10,000 pro-Saleh supporters rallied in Sanaa's Tahrir square, just four kilometers from where approximately 30,000 to 50,000 anti-Saleh protesters gathered at the University of Sanaa.
For and against the government
In the roughly two weeks since protests began in Yemen, an estimated 17 people have died and dozens hurt in clashes between anti-Saleh demonstrators and pro-government groups and security forces.
Since protests across the Middle East began to spread, opposition groups have squeezed concessions from Saleh, like a promise to not run in the 2013 presidential election and to enable more national political dialogue.
Yet anti-government protesters (and outside observers) accuse pro-Saleh groups of hiring thugs to beat them with daggers and clubs.
After pro-Saleh groups shot and killed two anti-government protesters on Tuesday, February 22 (and wounded many others), President Saleh ordered police to offer "full protection" to anti-government protesters, and, if necessary, separate them from pro-government groups.
Yemen is arguably the poorest country in the region, and the mostly young anti-Saleh protesters have been demanding economic development and human rights.
They say Saleh has been in power for too long (since 1978) and has reigned over a notoriously corrupt government with a poor human rights record.
Saleh supporters say his downfall would bring chaos to a country only 15 years removed from its last civil war with a southern secessionist movement.
Yemen still faces multiple security issues, like an on-again off-again war with tribes on its northern border.
Aden

Aden is the former capital of what was once the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen) before unifying with North Yemen in 1990 to form the current Republic of Yemen.
