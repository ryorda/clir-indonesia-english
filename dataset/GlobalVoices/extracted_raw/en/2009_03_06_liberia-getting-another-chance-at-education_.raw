Liberia: Getting another chance at education · Global Voices
Emily writes about Liberian youth getting another chance at education, "A vocational training school nestled in the mountains in Yekepa and ravaged during Liberia’s civil war is being restored to its former self.
This March, 100 students ages 13 to 25 will come to live here and learn to be electricians, mechanics and farmers.
80% of the students are female.
Many are former child soldiers caught up during the war and demobilized by the IRC."
