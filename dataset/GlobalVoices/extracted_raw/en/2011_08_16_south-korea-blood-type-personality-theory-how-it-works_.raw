South Korea: Blood Type Personality Theory, How It Works Â· Global Voices
In which countries in the world does everyone know their blood types?
The answer has to be Japan and South Korea.
The considerable interest in blood types in the two countries has become something of a running joke , especially when compared to Western countries in which many people don't know - and don't really care about - their blood group.
Whilst evident across Asia, nowhere is the 'blood type personality theory' more strongly adhered to than in Japan and South Korea, with books, comics, songs, and products on sale, all based on the idea.
On South Korean Facebook, people can even add their blood type to their profile along with other important personal information.
Although this fad has somehow faded over the recent years, its popularity is still strong, somewhat equivalent to that of horoscopes in Western countries.
Blood type personality theory
According to the theory, people's ABO blood type is predictive of their personality, temperament, and compatibility with others.
The adjectives which best describe the traits of each blood type are as follow: Type A is considerate but shy, B is creative but whimsical, O is sociable but unorganized and AB is rational but calculating.
The images below, created by cartoonist Park Dong Sun, exhibit how each blood type behaves in a certain situation.
Park's cartoon scripts on blood type personalities are published on South Korea's largest portal site, Naver.com on a regular basis.
Even though there are criticisms that his works often over-simplify the complex human personalities, they are widely loved by Koreans.

The most organised, Type A, softly complains about who packed the vacation baggage, Type AB points at Type O and B for lousy packing.

Short-tempered Type O is cooling off by sitting right in front of an electric fan, very noisily and repetitively complaining about the weather.
Type B, so irritated, is on the verge of hitting Type O. Type AB is paying no attention to any of them.

Type AB, the rarest blood type, is always pictured as a sort of outsider, even an alien sometimes.

Harmless fun or dark relic?
Although harmless, cute images are adopted to explain the blood type personality theory in cartoons, the theory itself is a relic of the dark past.
It is often traced back to the scientific racism used first by Nazis and later by Japanese imperialists to promote ideas of supremacy over different races or countries during the 1920s-30s.
When Austrian scientists first found the four different blood types, it was a truly ground-breaking research which later saved countless human lives by preventing them from receiving mismatched blood transfusions.
However, later studies revealed that the different blood groups are distributed disproportionately across the world and this prompted some racist, imperialist researchers to publish non-statical reports on the theory of blood type personalities.
One famous piece of research was done by Japanese scholar Furukawa, who focused on the racial traits of the Taiwanese who revolted against Japanese imperialism.
The researcher concluded that since more than 40 percent of Taiwanese had type O blood, which is believed to be the least submissive type, they needed to dilute the country's 'rebellious blood' by increasing intermarriages with Japanese.
Even after many Japanese academics discredited the theory for its lack of scientific basis, it somehow managed to survive through several sensational publications, with the help of media's unyielding interest.
Starting from late 1990s, this fad spread to South Korea, gaining huge popularity in early 2000, and has been famous ever since.
South Korean blogger Age of Mass Production Type Romance reflected Korean public sentiment toward the theory.
Although the blogger admitted that the blood type personality lacks scientific evidence, his experience has convinced him that it is a sure-fire way to categorize people:
