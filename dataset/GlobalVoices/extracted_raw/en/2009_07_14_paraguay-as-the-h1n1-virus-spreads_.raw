Paraguay: As the H1N1 Virus Spreads · Global Voices
Not getting caught in the traffic jam of España Avenue on a weekday at 2 p.m. is a daunting task.
That is why seeing the street almost deserted nowadays is stunning for most Paraguayans.
“I’ve never seen something quite like this before, everybody is paranoid now,” says blogger Nora Vega, who commutes to downtown Asunción every day.
What is keeping Paraguayans inside their houses is the fast spread of H1N1 virus, which has already claimed three lives and infected hundreds of citizens.
Last week the National Congress declared a national health emergency for 90 days and granted an extra 99 billion guaranies (about 20 million dollars) to the health ministry to deal with the swine flu epidemic.
The government is now analyzing the possibility of extending the two-week winter break for schools to prevent more children from getting the virus.
The city hall closed several public buildings and theaters for ten days.
The action was taken despite Health Minister Esperanza Martinez’s statements, who warned that this type of measures were not effective to stop the spread of the virus in countries such as Mexico and the United States.
Although the health ministry has only confirmed three deaths officially, it is suspected that at least 15 other deaths are related to the virus.
So far 114 cases of infections are official, but there are about 700 other suspicious cases.
One of the reasons why these cases cannot be confirmed is because of the shortage of materials to perform the analysis.
Other major concern is the scarcity of antibiotics, especially in the private sector.
Journalist and blogger Mabel Rehnfeldt on her blog El Dedo en la Llaga shares the frustration of having two daughters infected with the virus:
