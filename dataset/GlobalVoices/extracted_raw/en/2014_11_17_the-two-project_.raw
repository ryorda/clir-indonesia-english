Poetry Project Bridges Language and Cultural Barriers between Arabic and Hebrew Speakers in Israel · Global Voices
The Two Project promotes Arabic and Hebrew arts and culture through the language of poetry.
The Two Project has just launched, a collaboration between Israeli Jews and Arabs to connect their cultures through the language of poetry.
Hebrew and Arabic are both official languages of Israel.
Six years in the making, the project is an offshoot of a recently published book, Two: A Bilingual Anthology (link is in Hebrew).
On their website, the Two Project's creators Almog Behar, Tamer Massalha, and Tamar Weiss write :
This site is a part of the Two Project: a bilingual cultural project focusing on the literature and poetry of youth.
Its aim is to create a convergence of dialogue between the two vibrant cultures of Israel, in Arabic and Hebrew. a new generation of writers and readers, who because of language barriers, culture, politics, and physical boundaries are not familiar with what goes on in the modern literary scene of their neighbors.
Anat Niv, editor-in-chief of Keter Publishing, who is responsible for the anthology, remarks:
The very fact that you are holding a book and reading it in Hebrew, with a text in Arabic script on the facing page, or vice versa, is a very powerful experience.
Even if you don’t read Arabic, when reading this book you can no longer remain oblivious to the fact that this is a place where people live and create in two languages.
Follow the project on their website or on Facebook in Hebrew and Arabic.
Two new authors, an Israeli Arab and an Israeli Jew, will be featured monthly.
