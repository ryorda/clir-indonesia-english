Wikileaks reveals how Singapore views its neighbors · Global Voices
Former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew thinks North Koreans are ‘psychopathic types’ and their leader is a ‘flabby old chap.’
Senior Singapore diplomats believe that Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib Razak is an opportunist while opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim is guilty of sodomy.
They also describe deposed Thailand leader Thaksin Shinawatra as “corrupt” along with “everyone else, including the opposition.”
Japan is ‘the big fat loser’ as relationship between China and Southeast Asian nations continues to improve.
The source of these sensational revelations is Wikileaks.
It is up to the readers to believe in the authenticity of these exposed cable reports.
What is certain is that this latest batch of releases from Wikileaks will keep the Singapore government busy in the next few days and weeks as they try to minimize the damage caused by these reports in their foreign relations.
Meanwhile, here are blog and twitter reactions from Malaysia.
Din Merican is disappointed that the attitude of Singapore officials has remained “contemptuous” of Malaysia
It will be interesting to see how Singaporean diplomats can diffuse this situation.
As someone who has consistently supported better relations between Malaysia and Singapore and regards himself as a friend of Singapore, I am disappointed to note that the attitude of officials in Singapore has remained contemptuous of Malaysia.
Old habits of mind are certainly difficult to change.
I would have thought our two countries could move forward on the basis of mutual respect and interests with the warming of relations between the two Prime Ministers.
Ktemoc points out that the proof of Anwar Ibrahim’s purported guilt in the sodomy case is not factual but only hearsay
I read the news yesterday, and it’s an aspect of Anwar Ibrahim I have never really been interested in, well, for a couple of reasons.
One, so long as it was consensual between adults then it bothers me not; two, it’s news that came about from a series of “I was told by …, who was told by …, who heard it from …, “ so it’s technically not factual, hearsay evidence so to speak.
So what’s the big deal?
But let’s examine in more details where or who the source was.
The Yanks heard it from the Aussies; the Aussies heard it from the Sings, in particular LKY; the Sings claimed they extracted it from ‘technical’ intelligence, meaning electronic interception or even land line eavesdropping.
rocky's bru tells his readers that he has not yet signed the petition to support Wikileaks
Bugger.
So, we all support press freedom, right?
We all signed up the petition to defend WikiLeaks, eh?
Now, according to Wikileaks, the Aussies and the kiasu Singaporeans knew about Dr Anwar and Saiful all along, about it being a set-up and how Dr Anwar had known that it was an entrapment but didn't - or could not - give a damn.
Wow.
Damning ni.
Because it is Wikileaks, more people will believe that Saiful was buggered.
Right?
By the way, I haven't signed the petition to support Wikileaks.
Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad of Parti Keadilan Rakyat urges the publication of the ‘technical intelligence’ which was allegedly used by Singapore with regards to the case of Anwar
It should furthermore be pointed out that the cables exposed by Wikileaks are essentially information collected by third parties – like Australia – that were then shared to the US State Department.
As a result, the cables contain all manner of information – including personal opinions and hearsay and hence are far from reliable.
I hope the ‘technical intelligence’ mentioned in Wikileaks could be revealed to the public since that was the basis that the Singaporean intelligence claimed led to their conclusion.
My Words, My Freedom is more worried about the ability of Singapore to intercept Malaysian communications
what concern me much about the leak is that, if it was true, how safe our secret information is? if the singapore intelligence can easily intercept our communications, what our security officials are doing? and, i'm afraid that our military secrets can also be compromised! hey folks, our security is much more important that anwar and saiful's case! as my friend always say, "the future of our country is not depending on these two figures!" so, let's focus on more important issue than this sodomy case! ;)
Malaysiakini gathers the views of readers about the latest Wikileaks report.
Rolls-Royce opines
The intelligence services always think they are more intelligent than others.
Honestly, how much of the so-called leaked information are actually hunches that most of us have already had anyway?
Singapore talking bad about Malaysia, US talking bad about North Korea and Burma, Pakistan or Malaysia talking bad about Israel or Singapore, etc.
These are to be expected.
If we think these are great enlightenments, then we are the idiots.
Twitter reactions from Kuala Lumpur
CliffCLF: Wikileaks said that Malaysia was in a ‘’confused and dangerous’’ state due to “its incompetent politicians”. couldn't agree more though.
equal_o_not: @jonathanfun @timmysay just cos Wikileaks says that some1 thinks M'sia set him up?
Fat chance......unless solid proof is provided.
sultanmuzaffar: WikiLeaks is now officially relevant to the Malaysians.
More please!
drcheehoe: have second thoughts of #wikileaks being helpful instead of harmful.
I prefer to think the cable leak about @anwaribrahim merely 'cakap'
stephendoss: @matkeri the info is between diplomatic cables, wikileaks just exposes, it is not in a position to determine truth or falsity @Aisehman
YeoWai: actually who needs Wikileaks to tell us our politician is incompetent?
matkeri: @Aisehman bro, back to the source : WikiLeaks.
No source, no leaks.
Just a controversial rpt by a Sunday tabloid. :D
For his part, Anwar tweeted that the cable reports from Wikileaks strengthened his argument that there was a conspiracy on the part of the Malaysian government to set him up with a sodomy case and destroy his political career.
