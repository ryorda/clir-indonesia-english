Southeast Asia: Twitter reactions on Suu Kyi guilty verdict · Global Voices
Myanmar opposition leader and global democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi was sentenced to three years imprisonment for violating the terms of her detention.
Myanmar’s military ruler Snr Gen Than Shwe later commuted the sentence to 18 months of house arrest.
Myanmar authorities accused Suu Kyi of allowing American national John Yettawv to stay in her lakeside house last May which is a violation of the terms of her house arrest.
The American was sentenced to seven years of hard labour and imprisonment.
Both Suu Kyi and Yettawv are appealing the guilty verdict.
Suu Kyi’s conviction was condemned by world leaders, Burmese activists, and also bloggers.
Twitterers based in Southeast Asia also reacted to the “harsh” sentence:
