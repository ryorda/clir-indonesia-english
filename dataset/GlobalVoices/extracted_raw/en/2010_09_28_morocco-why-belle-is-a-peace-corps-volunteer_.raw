Morocco: "Why Belle is a Peace Corps Volunteer" · Global Voices
A blog meme is making the rounds amongst female Peace Corps Volunteers in Morocco; though neither of the bloggers who posted the meme disclosed its origins, both women say that they relate to it.
The meme in question?
"Why Belle, from Beauty and the Beast, is actually a Peace Corps Morocco volunteer."
Showing a video (below) from the film, the post (posted here by absolute uncertainty and here on the blog Hillary's Moroccan Adventure) enumerates 25 similarities between the character's life and the lives of female volunteers in the country.
Hillary explains:
If you ever wanted to understand what I go through as female Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco check out this clip from Beauty and the Beast.
What Belle experiences in this clip is my life in a nutshell here in Morocco.
"People scream “Bonjour!” at her from windowsills and alleyways," reads example #2. #15 describes a common occurrence in the Kingdom: "Belle goes on and on about how much she loves something, which basically requires the nice goat-man to give it to her.
You often see this in Morocco."
