South Korea: Controversial Launch of Online Music Video Rating · Global Voices
South Korean authorities have launched a new ratings system for music videos posted online.
The new bill requires every music video (or promotional video) and even movie trailers to be rated prior to upload.
Failure to comply will result in up to two years in prison or a hefty fine.
Artists and South Korean net users have labeled it a new form of enhanced censorship on cultural contents and a regression in freedom of expression.
It comes into effect starting August 18, 2012.
Censorship extends to online platforms
Previously, only television stations were responsible for airing music videos, whereas the new bill extends the censorship to video clips published on online platforms, including YouTube, blogs and Internet bulletin boards.
The law is applied even to clips, not for profit organisations, and various music and movie teasers.
The authorities argue that the new measure is to protect young, impressionable audiences from the flow of indecent or violent music videos.
Some predict the bill will first make content labeled 'not for children under age 19′ by the Korea Media Rating Board inaccessible to mass audiences, and in the long-run (as one media pundit worries ) will eventually lead every citizen to ask for, or at least consider, permission before uploading any content online.

A net user who introduced himself as a 28-year-old working in the music promotion industry, filed an online petition opposing the new rating system.
The petition has gathered more than 10,000 signatures.
