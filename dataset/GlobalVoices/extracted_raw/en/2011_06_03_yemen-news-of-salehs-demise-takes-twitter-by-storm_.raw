The Yemeni capital Sanaa plunged into chaos this afternoon, with conflicting reports circulating about Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh.
While some reports say he had fled the presidential palace in Sanaa, others are reporting that he was injured in clashes.
Some even went to announce his death.
Here's a round up of reactions from Twitter in the previous hour.
Mohamed Abdel Daymen tweets:
#Saleh "light injuries" now confirmed by multiple reliable sources.
So at least that much is true.
