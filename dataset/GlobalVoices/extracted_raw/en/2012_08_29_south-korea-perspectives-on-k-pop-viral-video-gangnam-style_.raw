South Korea: K-Pop Video 'Gangnam Style' Goes Viral Internationally Â· Global Voices
South Korean singer Psy's tune 'Gangnam Style' has gone viral internationally, with its YouTube video (below) surpassing 70 million hits as of today since its release in mid-July.
This is the greatest hit in K-Pop (Korean Pop) history, and has got many Koreans talking.
The scope of discussions vary from simple praise of Psy's (short for Psycho, real name is Park Jae-sang) success, reviews of his marketing and social media strategies, criticism of other mainstream pop singers heavily invested in by their record agencies, to more detailed analysis of Koreans' deep-seated insecurity about their country.
South Korean net users, although well aware of Psy's great performance and catchy and satirical songs, are also bewildered by this explosive success not only on the local level, but also on the international level.
International viewers meanwhile comment on this YouTube video that although they love the song, they really don't understand what the song's lyrics are about.
And they are not the only ones.
Even many South Koreans, such as blogger Gl-Meet, admit they dont fully get the lyrics, because they are disjointed and nowhere close to having a storyline - just like many other catchy pop songs.
The basic commentary people agree is as follows: Gangnam is Seoul's poshest neighborhood and in the video Psy acts in a exaggerated Gangnam man's character who brags about how great he is at impressing girls.
It can be interpreted as a satire lampooning rich Koreans' self-importance, as well as materialistic South Korean society.
Many media outlets have not only interpreted the song but gone on further to dissect the lyrics seriously, such as a this detailed, sophisticated, but slightly over-the-top review by the Atlantic.
