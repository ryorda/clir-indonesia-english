Tabra is an association launched by Guillermo Ferrero and Andrea Mesones in Peru that aims to improve life quality for children with autism and Down syndrome through surfing and contact with nature, as stated on their Facebook page.
Guillermo is the father of a 13-year-old boy diagnosed with autism, and Andrea is a psychology student at a university in Lima.
Tabra was born of the desire to try new alternatives to achieve a significant improvement in children with problems in their cognitive development, giving them opportunities to expand their world.
During every monthly two-hour session, "They try to have newcomers, so everybody can participate."
Due to their logistics, they can allow only ten to 12 children per session.
As Guillermo Ferrero says:
The happiness they feel when they are in the sea is so contagious that you really end a session with Tabra with the heart and spirit full of energy for all that these children transmit during the time they are connected with the ocean.
About the name Tabra, the blog Seis de enero tells:
The name came up spontaneously one day when we were just talking by the sea and the boy started to say "I want tabra", with a bad pronunciation of the word tabla (the Spanish word for surfboard).
