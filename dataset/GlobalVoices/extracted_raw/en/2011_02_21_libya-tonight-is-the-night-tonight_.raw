Libya: "Tonight is the night.
TONIGHT." · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Libya Uprising 2011.
Events in Libya can no longer be termed just anti-government protests.
Fighting with anything from heavy weapons to clubs and sticks has broken out throughout certain cities between defecting members of the military who have joined civilians against the remaining factions of Muammar Al Gaddafi's government and foreign mercenaries he has brought in to protect his regime.
As of 11 PM Sunday, February 20 local time in Libya, media reported heavy gunfire and fires in the capitol Tripoli.
Benghazi, the heart of Saturday's protest, still has unconfirmed reports that what remains of the military in the country's second-largest city has joined the side of protesters.
Gunshots were also heard at Col. Ghadaffi's residence.
Everything is happening very fast.
Once again: To keep up with protests in Libya (and government reactions), please view this map created by @Arasmus from “trusted Twitter accounts” to help with communication gap as independent media in Libya is scarce.
This site also collects regularly updated Twitter feeds.
The Twitter masses are relentlessly trying to keep up with events across the country.
