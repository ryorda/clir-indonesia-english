Dominican Republic: The Financial Cost of Undocumented Haitian Immigrants · Global Voices
The countries of the Dominican Republic and Haiti share the same island, which has commonly been known as Hispaniola ever since its discovery by Christopher Columbus in 1492.
During that time, the island was compromised of the same territory and remained that way until 1697, with the signing of the Treaty of Ryswick, Spain ceded the western part of the island to France, which was renamed Saint-Domingue.

This colony was gradually populated by African slaves, and who eventually rebelled against their French colonizers.
It was in this manner in 1804 that Haiti was born, becoming the first independent country in Latin America.
By 1822, Haiti had total control of the island and occupied Santo Domingo until February 27, 1844, when a secret society called "La Trinitaria" led by among others, Juan Pablo Duarte, was created to gain independence from Haiti and to create what is now the Dominican Republic.
Since that day, the Dominican Republic and Haiti have been two independent nations, with a different culture, beliefs, and system.
Their paths of economic development has also varied greatly, with Haiti being the least developed country in the Americas and the Dominican Republic enjoys one of the largest economies in the Caribbean and Central America.
Despite these stark contrasts, it is the close proximity of these two countries that have the intertwined their own fates.
A large number of Haitians cross the border on a daily basis, usually illegally, to look for work as construction workers or to work as street vendors selling fruit, candy or other small, inexpensive items.
Others may be specially contracted to work on sugarcane plantations.

Due to the large numbers of undocumented Haitians in the Dominican Republic, a large percentage can be seen in the streets as beggars.
These visible examples often leaves Dominicans with a negative stereotyped view of all Haitians.
However, there is still a smaller percentage that arrive legally with intentions to study, often with scholarships, but may not be the typical profile of Haitans in the country.
