Korea: Have You Ever Killed a Person? · Global Voices
A sixteen year-old Korean girl who became famous due to the extreme success of losing weight killed herself.
To please her grandmother who was worried about her grand-daughter’s heavy weight, the girl lost about 40 kilograms in three months.
Her story was introduced on a TV entertainment program.
At that time, she took a photo with one of her favorite singers.
Her death is assumingly caused by netizens’ ak-peul (notorious reply: trackbacks or comments which netizens abuse targeting specific people or events).
The jealousy of the singers’ fans left ak-peul related to her news in internet and her internet homepage.
Some of them even harassed her on her phone.
The exact reason for her death has not been cleared yet.
But according to her friends and families, she has been depressed due to ak-peul.
Recently several entertainers committed suicide due to ak-peul and depression.
Some of the entertainers are suing a group of ak-peul-reo (people who do ak-peul).
Bloggers brought the problems of netizens’ attitudes out.
A blogger, your inside, posted a netizen’s response right after her death with a picture that caused the problem.
