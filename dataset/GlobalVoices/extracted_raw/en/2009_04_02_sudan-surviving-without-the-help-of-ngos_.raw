Sudan: Surviving without the help of NGOs · Global Voices
On March 4th, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan.
In retaliation, 13 NGO’s were banished from the country the day after, a number that rose to 16 within the week.
As a result, a handful of projects have halted operations: those offering drinkable water supply, food distribution, health care and teaching systems among others.
Consequently, many Sudanese people were forced to leave the country, seeking asylum abroad.
Victor Angelo was in Goz Beida camp, 200 kilometers south east of Abeche, in Chad, and from there he sent some pictures and reported on attacks by the Jenjawid, or “men on horses”, a militia allegedly paid by the Sudanese government.
“The reaction in Khartoum by the government was almost instantaneous.
After speaking with some relatives in Sudan, the situation seems normal and as one of my cousins put it, ‘business is as usual.'
People were expecting there to be a coordinated attack by the Darfuri rebel group Justice and Equality Movement, similar to the one that occurred back in May 2008.
People also expected for general violence to breakout, but none of the sort has happened.
That being said, people are very tense on the ground and anxious for what is to come.
I think people are worried most about the implications on the North-South peace agreement (CPA) and the reaction of the southern government.
Here are the positions of Sudanese most prominent political parties.
Also, the government has kicked out several international NGOs, among them are OXFAM, Care, and Doctors without Borders.”
The forecast made by the majority of NGOs is that a disaster will happen in the refugee centres, and that an estimated 4.7 million people will be affected, of whom an exodus of 2.7 million is expected.
What’s more, 1.5 million need some medical help, 1.1 million do not have food to eat and a million do not have access to water (data from OCHA).
In addition, there is a meningitis outbreak and "no treatment available in the camp, no one to refer patients to the hospital in Nyala, and no mass vaccination.
It means that people may die”, reports Lydia Geirsdottir (MSF).
Because of this, Lise Grande, the UN’s Deputy Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Southern Sudan said: "One of the things that those assessments will look at is possible migration flows".
There are more than 100,000 people vulnerable as a result of the upsurge of LRA attacks including over 36,000 internally displaced people who fled their homes in South Sudan, and more than 16,000 refugees from the DRC.
"An additional 50,000 people in host communities … are reported to be vulnerable and need humanitarian assistance," said Grande.
Migration has already started, and some reports have already started to appear via blogs.
The sudan-blog reports the reconstruction of a new camp of refugees in Chad, a neighboring country, which expects to attend to about 6,000 refugees.
