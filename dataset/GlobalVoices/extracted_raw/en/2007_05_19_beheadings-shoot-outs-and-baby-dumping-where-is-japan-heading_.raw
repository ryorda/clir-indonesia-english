Beheadings, Shoot-outs and Baby Dumping: Where is Japan heading? Â· Global Voices
News stories covered this week by the mainstream news media in Japan have shaken Japanese society, with many wondering where their country is heading and what has happened to the nation's youth.
Most sensational among these stories is the shocking tale of a high-school boy who killed and beheaded his mother, then carried the head with him to an Internet cafe before turning himself over to the police.
(It is noteworthy that this is not the first time that this type of crime has occurred in Japan.)
Police reported that after admitting to the crime, the boy said: "I want terrorism and war to disappear from the world," and explained that: "It doesn't matter who I choose to kill."
Next up is the story of a 24-hour standoff involving a former yakuza gangster, who hid in his suburban home holding his former wife as hostage.
The standoff finally ended, but not before the man killed one police officer, injured another, and also injured his own son and daughter.
Add to these two the story of the first Japanese "Akachan Post" (Baby Post, also referred to as a "Stork's Cradle"), a kind of "baby hatch" measuring 50 centimetres by 60 centimetres, opening onto a small heated compartment.
Parents who, for whatever reason, cannot take care of their children can drop off their young babies in this hatch; hospital personnel are alerted when the door is opened, and immediately come to receive the baby.
The idea of introducing a "Baby Post" was sparked by the rise in cases of child abandonment in Japan.
One such case, also in the spotlight this week, involved a couple whose baby died in the luggage compartment of their motorbike as they gambled their money away at a local pachinko parlour, the baby's body later found dumped in the gutter.
Although the Baby Post may help avoid horrific situations such as these, the system is not without its detractors.
On its first day of operation, a man apparently misunderstood the intended age range of the "Stork's Cradle" and dropped off his 3-year-old son into the baby hatch, telling him that they were just playing hide-and-go-seek.
The boy apparently could talk and was able to identify himself by name.
What do Japanese people think about all these stories?
Many expressed great distress about what is happening to Japanese society.
