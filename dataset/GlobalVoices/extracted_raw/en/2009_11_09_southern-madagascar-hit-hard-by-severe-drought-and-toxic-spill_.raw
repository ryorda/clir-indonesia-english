Southern Madagascar Hit Hard by Severe Drought and Toxic Spill Â· Global Voices
While the political direction of Madagascar remains mired in total uncertainty since the coup d'etat in March, in Addis Ababa, the international community is again trying to mediate an agreement between the various political movements.
The president of the African Union and one of the mediators present in Addis Ababa, Jean Ping, opened the meeting by stating:
"The reality as you know it on the ground in Madagascar is characterized by fatigue that is felt by the people of Madagascar, people who are hoping the crisis will come to an end.
A crisis to which, after all, they are the hostages.
Whereas the socio-economic situation in your country is getting worse day by day.
The people of Madagascar deserve better destiny and that depends completely on you"
This sentiment seems to be shared by a large portion of the blogosphere who focused their attention on the other challenges affecting Madagascar.
Several provinces are currently plagued by the cumulative disastrous effects of a severe drought, the toxic spill of a ship wreck that poisoned the livelihood of thousands of fishermen and the ecological disaster of illegal logging of the rain forests.
(Update: A power sharing agreement was signed by the 4 political movements over the week-end (BBC) where Madagascar will be led by 3 co-presidents.

The ecological scandal of the Gulser Ana toxic spill
The Gulser Ana was a Turkish freighter transporting Phosphate that sunk off the coast of Madagascar, spilling toxic waste in the process and killing migrating whales and causing illness among the fishermen community.
Although the disaster has been reported in a few media recently, the ship started to sink two months ago as Malagasy bloggers signaled on their blogs back in early September.
Tomavana wrote on his blog (fr):
The only explanation which can exculpate the Captain and Officer of the Watch of this vessel is mechanical breakdown.
Anything else is human error, and therefore incompetence, if not recklessness.
How can a ship go aground in perfect visibility if the OOW and Captain are paying attention and properly trained?
Another practice to save money.
The Captain and OOW should have been arrested when they got ashore, and held.
Mialisoa reports on her blog that (fr):
I noticed that the weather had changed from our usual predictions, and the rainy seasons were starting very late...
Not only was rice production affected, but also sweet potatoes and cassava.
It was getting hotter and hotter, which made planting cassava challenging...
When I harvested it, I discovered that the roots had become smaller, compared to my previous harvest.
In terms of rice, I used to collect three to four large baskets and now I can harvest only one small basket.
The change is so obvious that it makes me ask the question, "What is happening to the climate?"
A recent academic paper for the American Political Science Association by Richard Marcus illustrates the challenges of water resource management in the Ambovombe-Androy region.
The paper states that
"Rural communities are suddenly faced with having to pay exorbitant costs for water.
They are ill-prepared to carry out their municipal functions and unable to raise the level of user-fees or community taxes necessary to fund infrastructure development"
Stephane, a blogger from Foko Madagascar attended the UN conference on climate change in September and blogged about the challenges facing developing countries like Madagascar.
Finally, a resolution to condemn the plundering of natural resources in Madagascar has been introduced by Earl Blumenauer (D-Oregon) at the House of Representatives.
Illegal logging of precious woods from the rain forest has been increasing with the political turmoil.
Courier International and l'Express de Madagascar also reveals that the government allowed for exportation of precious rosewood in late September (fr).
More details on the illegal logging of the rain forest are available here (fr) .
