Paris court investigates three African leaders · Global Voices
"In Africa, you never look Presidents in the mouth.
They are, as it is said in popular language, groundnut roasters.
And you don't look a groundnut roaster in his mouth.
Because then he will definitely throw in some grains."
(Ivorian blogger Denis Zado)
Earlier this week, a Parisian judge ordered an inquiry into alleged corruption and embezzlement on the part of three African heads of state: Denis Sassou-Nguesso of Congo-Brazzaville, Omar Bongo of Gabon, and Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea.
Teodoro Obiang has been president of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea for thirty years.
His luxury apartment and collection of cars are alleged to have been bought with misappropriated funds.
The investigation comes following a complaint filed by Transparency International in December accusing Sassou-Nguesso, Bongo and Obiang of "concealing misappropriated public funds."
Each keep several luxury residences in Paris, thought to have been purchased with money that rightly belongs to their people.
Bloggers from each of these countries, and francophone Africa more generally, have long criticized Françafrique, France's neocolonial legacy of cozy relations with resource-rich, African dictators.
French president Nicholas Sarkozy has failed to end this legacy, despite early promises.
At last!
The French court's decision was greeted by many as a welcome surprise, one that may mark a shift in French attitudes toward Africa.
