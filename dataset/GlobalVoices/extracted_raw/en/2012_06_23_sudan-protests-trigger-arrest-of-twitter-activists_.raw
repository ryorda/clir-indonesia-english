Sudan: Protests Trigger Arrest of Twitter Activists · Global Voices
Yesterday’s protests saw the arrest of many protesters from the streets by police and National Intelligence Security Service (NISS) agents.
Among them is prominent Sudanese Twitter personality and activist Usamah Mohammed Ali (@simsimt).
In his last tweet, Usamah was advocating free content to help spread the word about the events happening on the streets in the capital Khartoum:
Btw, I'm just being technical.
You can use my tweets without even mentioning me.
Free content advocate here!
Usamah’s last couple of tweets included information about his whereabouts and the situation on the ground.
He was in Burri area next to Nile Street :
#FreeUsamah
@simsimt is not released yet!
And I don't know where is he!!
According to Asaad, Usamah was taken to NISS headquarters in Khartoum North while he himself was taken to a police station in Khartoum.
Usamah’s friends were tweeting their concern for his safety and demanding his immediate release.
Ayman Elkhidir showed his concern for Usamah,
Good night.
Hopefully tomorrow will bring better news from ‪#Sudan, with inshallah @Simsimt, Ahmed Hussein, and all the others free.
Several other Sudanese Twitter users have been arrested and released, such as Omer Mahgoub (@OmarMahgoub), who was released today.
He was held in the same building as Usamah, but says he has not seen him.
Usamah has been in the custody of the notorious NISS for over 24 hours, and his twitter friends are campaigning for him using #FreeUsamah.
In the wake of the ongoing protests taking place in Khartoum and other states calling on the fall of the regime, numerous other peaceful protesters have been kidnapped by the NISS and many of them were tortured.
