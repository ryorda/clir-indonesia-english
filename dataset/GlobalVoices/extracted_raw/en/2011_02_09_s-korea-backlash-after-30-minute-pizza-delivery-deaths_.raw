South Korea: Backlash After '30 Minute' Pizza Delivery Death · Global Voices
A popular Domino's Pizza marketing strategy promising pizza delivery within 30 minutes of an order has met with a public backlash in South Korea, following the deaths of several young delivery personnel.
The Young Union, the union For Occupational and Environmental Health (FOEC) and several labor unions held a press conference on 8 February, 2011, in front of Domino's Pizza’s headquarters in South Korean capital Seoul, pressuring the company to abolish the '30 Minute' delivery system.

The issue gathered huge media attention in December, 2010, when a 24 year old part-time delivery boy died in a car accident whilst delivering an order .
Three more people from the same brand have died in similar circumstances last year alone.
According to the Korean Ministry of Employment and Labor, more than 7,000 thousand delivery-related motorbike accidents are recorded per year.
Several thousand people, including a celebrity author, famous actress and several academics have officially expressed concern over the '30 Minute' system; it pressurises delivery personnel to drive fast and dangerously, as they are given penalties or forced to pay for the cost of the order when the 30 minutes delivery deadline is not met.
The '30 Minute Guarantee' was originally introduced by Domino's Pizza in the United States in 1973, but was eventually dropped after several lawsuits related to dangerous driving associated with the policy.
Hostile Working Conditions
When most big pizza brands receive complaints about slow delivery, they give away a free pizza or a discount.
In the case of Domino's South Korea, when 30 minutes have passed since an order, customers get a 2,000 Won (around 2 USD) discount for each pizza.
After 45 minutes, customers get a free pizza or free side dish.
What aggravates the already hostile working conditions delivery personnel experience in the country, are customers who hold their elevator or do not answer the door to postpone delivery in order to get a free pizza.
Some customers demand delivery even on extremely snowy days, when many other pizza parlors do not accept take-out orders.
Gloria Gu, an intern researcher for FOEC writes on the page dedicated to the '30 Minute' issue on social networking site Facebook, "15 minutes is enough time to kill a innocent man".
It is believed that an average of 15 minutes are spent on making a pizza.
She encourages more people to join the social protest:
