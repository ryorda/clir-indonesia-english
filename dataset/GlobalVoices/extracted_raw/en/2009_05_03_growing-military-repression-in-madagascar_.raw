Growing Military Repression in Madagascar · Global Voices
While more protests have erupted in Madagascar and were repressed severely by armed forces, the members of the transitional government of Madagascar have been hard at work explaining the circumstances of their rise to power to the international community.
The recent reversal of the high constitutional court (HCC) decision on the illegitimacy of the power transfer (fr) seems to have caught the transitional government by surprise and was what most likely led to the arrest of the head of security at the HCC.
Representatives of the UN security council and the African Union are meeting for a "Madagascar contact group" in Addis Ababa to ensure that the nations take a common position in pushing for a return to constitutional order in Madagascar.
Although each Malagasy political party announced that they had representatives present at the meeting, it turns out that none of the opposition parties were present during the decision-making process meeting.
In the meantime, former president Marc Ravalomanana, in exile in South Africa, appointed a new prime minister, Mandandafy Rakotonirina, to form a new government, in effect disputing the legitimacy of the transitional government.
A few days after Rakotonirina listed the new members of his cabinet, he and his acquaintances were arrested by the security forces on charges of "illegally declaring himself as prime minister, vandalism & possessing weapons".
Malagasy bloggers were quick to react news of the arrest:

Malagasy blogger, andrydago posts photos and describes the circumstances of the arrest of Rakotonirina in details and wonders whether the military thinks that this arrest will put an end to the movement.
