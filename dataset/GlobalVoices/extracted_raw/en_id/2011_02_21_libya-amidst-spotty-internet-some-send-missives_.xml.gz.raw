Libya: Mengirim Berita dengan Internet yang Terputus-putus
Pos ini merupakan bagian dari liputan khusus kami Gejolak di Libya 2011 .
Hanya 12 jam setelah pidato Saif Al Islam Al Gaddafi, di mana ia menyalahkan Facebook, tentara bayaran asing, Islamis, pecandu narkoba, dan tentara yang tidak terlatih untuk menangani warga sipil dalam gejolak yang terjadi belakangan ini, warga Libya masih bertahan dan terus memprotes.
Dengan layanan telepon dan Internet yang putus-putus, banyak yang mengirimkan pesan saat keadaan memungkinkan.
Khadija Teri bisa mendengar suara tembakan semalaman.

Libya: Amidst Spotty Internet, Some Send Missives Â· Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Libya Uprising 2011.
Just 12 hours after Saif Al Islam Al Gaddafi's speech, in which he blamed Facebook, foreign mercenaries, Islamists, drug addicts and an army not trained in dealing with civilians for the recent uprisings, Libyans are still going strong, and continue to protest.
With both phone service and the Internet in flux, many are sending out missives when they can.
Khadija Teri could hear gunfire overnight.
She writes:
We had a very long, sleepless night spent between watching reports on television and on the internet, and running outside in the garden, where we strained our ears to listen to the far off sounds of gunfire and car horns.
And then the shock of listening to 'the speech'.
Disbelief at what was being said.
What day is it, I wondered, surely it's not the first of April yet!
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings. . . . .
Oh Libyans...
Stay safe!.... no pun intended!
Highlander, who likens the situation in Libya to Tiananmen Square, writes:
(1) You are on this blog because you watch or read the news
(2) Despicable rats are jumping ship
(3) It is at times like these when you know who are your friends
(4) Tienanmen Redux ...
(5) Please follow up with those who are updating here (whenever they can) and see my sidebar links, there is a lot to digest and we have a lot on our plate.
(6) For those who care, I am currently relatively safe
(7) To the news outlet who wrote - sorry it is not possible
(8) To my people and country may you always be safe, we are one soul.
(9) Until further notice this is Highlander signing off
Internet service is still spotty at times.
A trusted Libyan source who wishes to remain anonymous e-mailed the following to Global Voices:
just to say we spent a night from hell. internet is back now but all phones are cut off. i went to get some milk for the kids today. it is a sight to make you cry in Tripoli. devastation and burning building - live ammo and stray bullets and airplanes and helicopters which we don't know where they are going. after the speech the defiance is getting bigger wish us luck.
The source continued:
There is shooting from different areas.
When asked if they are safe, the source added:
We're not really safe but this is life and I am not leaving my country of my house or my house/home.
Anyway travel is impossible, and banks are closed.
The city is a ghost town.
