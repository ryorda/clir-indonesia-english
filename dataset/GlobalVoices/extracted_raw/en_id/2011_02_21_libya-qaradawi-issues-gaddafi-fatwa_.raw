Pos ini merupakan bagian dari liputan khusus kami Gejolak di Libya 2011 .
Sementara pembantaian dan horor terus tersiar ke luar Libya dan mendominasi pemberitaan, ulama terkemuka Youssef Al Qaradawi mengeluarkan fatwa yang menyerukan kepada siapapun yang bisa menarik picu senjata untuk membunuh Kolonel Muammar Qaddafi dan mengakhiri penderitaan warga Libya.
Sementara itu, baik Mesir dan Tunisia, yang penduduknya telah bangkit dan menggulingkan Hosni Mubarak dan Zein El Abdideen Ben Ali, dan yang juga berbatasan dengan Libya, telah membuka perbatasan mereka untuk upaya kemanusiaan untuk membantu warga Libya, yang diserang oleh rezim Gaddafi.

Libya: Qaradawi Issues Gaddafi Fatwa Â· Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Libya Uprising 2011.
As the carnage and horror coming out of Libya continues to dominate our timelines, top Muslim cleric Youssef Al Qaradawi issued a fatwa (religious edict) calling for anyone who can pull the trigger, to kill Colonel Muammar Qaddafi and end the suffering of Libyans.
Meanwhile, both Egypt and Tunisia, which have had popular uprisings which have toppled Hosni Mubarak and Zein El Abdideen Ben Ali respectively, and which also flank Libya, have opened their borders for humanitarian relief to reach Libyans, under attack from the Gaddafi regime.
Following some of the reactions from Twitter:

To any army soldier, to any man who can pull the trigger & kill this man to do so.
