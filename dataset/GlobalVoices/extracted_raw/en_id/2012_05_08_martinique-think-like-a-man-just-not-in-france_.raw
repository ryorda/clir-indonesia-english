Martinik: "Think Like A Man", Namun Jangan Di Prancis
Baru beberapa minggu berlalu sejak berkumandangnya perdebatan seputar pemilihan Putri Kulit Hitam Prancis 2012, komunitas keturunan Afrika di Prancis mendiskusikan suatu hal: pembatalan premier film Amerika yang berjudul "Think Like A Man" di bioskop-bioskop.
Bagaimana bisa sebuah film Amerika menjadi dasar perdebatan sosial di Prancis?
Mungkin terdengar mengejutkan, jawaban untuk pertanyaan ini terletak pada fakta bahwa seluruh bintang film ini berkulit hitam.
Dunia perfilman Prancis seringkali dituding tidak adil akibat kurang menonjolkan komunitas multietnis negara tersebut.
Meskipun kesuksesan film Les Intouchables, dimana aktor Prancis keturuna Afrika Omar Sy berhasil memenangkan Cesar award untuk kategori Aktor Terbaik tahun 2012, berhasil menimbulkan rasa bangga warga Prancis keturunan Afrika dan Karibia, film tersebut tidak sontak menjadi titik awal perubahan berarti.

Blogger Martinik Bondamanjak amat sinis atas kemenangan tercoreng ini, menurutnya , nominasi Omar Sy tidak muncul secara alami, namun disebabkan oleh jumlah penonton di bioskop.


Martinique: "Think Like A Man", Just Not in France · Global Voices
UPDATE: May 23, 2012, 9:20 pm We understand from the Allo Ciné cinema website that the status of the film "Think Like a Man" is "prochainement" (coming soon), as it has been for quite some time.
Sony, the film's distributor, just issued a statement here, saying that there were never any plans for a French release date for the movie.
Thus, while Afro-American films are generally not "cancelled", strictly speaking, they are often not released, with no explanation.
One possible reason for this could be the nature of the film distribution system in the country: major companies do not customize releases; they release a film in hundreds of movie theaters, or not at all.
Smaller companies may release "arty" films that are likely to attract a niche audience in independent movie houses.
The Afro-French community does not, by and large, have specific movie houses or distribution systems in France, perhaps because census, geolocalization, surveys and marketing based on racial standards and statistics are strictly forbidden in the country.
Thus, movie-goers interested by Afro-american films usually have to wait for their video release.
Just weeks after the debate surrounding the election of Miss Black France 2012, another question is being discussed by French people of African descent: the cancellation alleged cancellation of the release of the American movie "Think Like A Man" in French movie theaters.
How does an American movie find a place in the French social debate?
Surprising as it may be, the answer lies in the fact that the film has an all-black cast.
French cinema is often pointed at for not fairly displaying all components of the country's multiethnic population.
Although the recent success of the movie Les Intouchables, which earned French African actor Omar Sy the Cesar award for Best Actor in 2012, caused great pride and hope among French nationals from Africa and the Caribbean, it was not to be the turning point for a deep and lasting change.

Martinican blogger Bondamanjak is very cynical after this tainted victory, as he explains that Omar Sy's award nomination did not come all naturally, but was rather due to the great number of viewers in theaters.
