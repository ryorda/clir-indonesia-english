Indonesia tidak asing lagi dengan bencan alam karena Indonesia terletak di Cincin Api Pasifik yang membuat wilayah Indonesia rentan terhadap badai, gempa, dan gunung meletus.
Minggu lalu, Indonesia mengalami dua bencana sekaligus, yaitu gempa yang menyebabkan tsunami di Mentawai dan letusan gunung Merapi dalam kurun waktu kurang dari 48 jam.
Jumlah korban meninggal diperkirakan lebih dari 500 jiwa dan ribuan keluarga memerlukan pertolongan yang secepatnya.

But this week, Indonesia was caught unprepared when an earthquake, tsunami and volcanic eruption battered the islands in less than 48 hours.
Casualties are expected to exceed 500 and thousands of families need immediate relief.
Photos of the impact of the triple disasters have been uploaded already on Facebook.

#prayforindonesia global conversation on trendsmapRelief efforts are coordinated by many groups, and also by the blogging community.
My condolences to the victims of tsunami in Mentawai, Sumatra and of vulcanic eruption of Mount Merapi in Central Java, this week.
Alas, same things repeat: slow response and lax coordination from the government, stupid minister blaming accidents on the victims for not obeying the God's rules, media blunders, insensitive netizens posting pictures of victims on soc meds, and so forth.
