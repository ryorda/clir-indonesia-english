Jordan: Tuntutan Untuk Menanggapi Libya Dipenuhi
Pos ini merupakan bagian dari liputan khusus kami Gejolak di Libya 2011 .
Selama demonstrasi masa di Tunisia dan kemudian di Mesir, warga Yordania menyelenggarakan demonstrasi sebagai wujud solidaritas, dan mengeposkan banyak blog dan tweet tentang peristiwa tersebut.
Gejolak di Libya bukan perkecualian; warga Yordania telah secara proaktif meneruskan tweet informasi tentang pergolakan di Libya dan menyatakan dukungan mereka terhadap penduduk Libya.
Sampai tanggal 22 Februari, sementara kekerasan di Libya terus meningkat, warga Yordania mulai bertanya-tanya mengapa pemerintah mereka belum mengeluarkan tanggapan untuk mengutuk Presiden Libya Muammar al-Gaddafi .

During the mass demonstrations in Tunisia and then in Egypt, Jordanians held demonstrations in solidarity, and posted numerous blogs and innumerable tweets about these events.
The uprising in Libya has been no exception to this pattern; Jordanians have pro-actively re-tweeted information on the Libyan uprising and expressed their support for the Libyan people.
By February 22nd, as the violence in Libya grew, Jordanians began to wonder why their government had not issued a response condemning Libyan President Muammar al-Gaddafi.

#ReformJo The silence of all arab gov's and the world on the massacre happening in libya by the lunatic Gadhafi and his son is a DiSCRACE
Diana Arja worked to distance herself from the government's silence: I am a Jordanian citizen; my government's silence does not honor me, does not represent me in Libya's massacre
Samih Toukan addressed his question to the Foreign Minister of Jordan, Nasser Judeh:
FM of Jordan @nasserjudeh why are you silent about the genocide in #Libya ? #reformjo
Ruba Abu-Laban was among those to add her agreement to Toukan's question:
We've been asking the same Q since morning with no reply RT @samihtoukan @nasserjudeh why r u silent about the genocide in #Libya? #reformjo
Razan Khatib complained:
Social media is the only space available to show our solidarity with the free people of the world as our govs stand silent. #Libya #ReformJo
Suleiman Bakhit provided a possible explanation for the government's silence:
Our govt primary concern is 10k #Jo citizens in #Libya, condemning #Qaddafi now would put their safety at risk #reformjo
And, their questions received a response, from Foreign Minister Judeh's twitter account.
He replied:
our position on tragic events in Libya very clear.
Prioirty is ensuring safety and safe return of our Jordanians there #jo #reformjo
Soon, Jordan did indeed issue a statement rejecting Libyan violence.
Ali Abu-Nimah was among the first to tweet the news:
Jordan strongly condemns Libya's attacks on civilians, says they violate international law (AR) http://t.co/foMgaKX #JO #ReformJO
Jordanians continue to tweet in solidarity with Libyans under the hashtags #feb17, #libya and their own pro-reform hashtag, #reformjo.
