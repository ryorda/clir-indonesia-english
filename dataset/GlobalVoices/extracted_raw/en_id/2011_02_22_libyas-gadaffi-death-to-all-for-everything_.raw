Libya Versi Gaddafi: Kematian bagi Semua Orang demi Segalanya
Pos ini merupakan bagian dari liputan khusus kami Gejolak di Libya 2011 .
Diktator Libya Muammar Al Gaddafi baru saja menyampaikan pidato yang berapi-api di TV nasional Libya hari ini, Selasa, memperingatkan dan mengancam demonstran antipemerintah dan pendukung mereka, bahwa Libya akan berakhir seperti Afghanistan, Irak, atau Somalia.
Ia mendorong warga Libya untuk keluar dari rumah mereka besok dan mengejar "para teroris" dan menyerahkan mereka kepada pasukan keamanan supaya bisa "dihukum mati".
Ia mengatakan akan tetap berjuang bagi Libya hingga "tetes darah penghabisan" dan mengurutkan secara rinci segala sesuatu yang akan diganjar hukuman mati, termasuk bekerja untuk perusahaan asing, menghadapi pasukan pemerintah dengan kekerasan, atau mengancam persatuan negeri.
Celotehan yang sepertinya tanpa naskah itu ditonton oleh warga Libya, Arab, dan warga dunia di Twitter, dan memancing sindiran dan tertawaan, bahkan di tengah tragedi kematian dan ketidakstabilan di negara tersebut.
Gaddafi memberi dalih atas tekanan brutal Libya terhadap demonstrasi yang terjadi belakangan ini dengan mengurutkan kesempatan-kesempatan lain dalam sejarah di mana pemerintah membunuh demonstran, dengan mengatakan di antaranya, “Persatuan China lebih penting daripada mereka yang berkumpul di Lapangan Tiananmen."
Besok, katanya, angkatan muda (yang "tidak terpengaruh narkotika") harus membentuk komite untuk membela revolusinya.
"Kalian lebih banyak daripada mereka," katanya.
Sementara menunggu pidatonya, para tweeple menebak-nebak dengan bercanda mengapa ia terlambat menyampaikan pidato yang ditunggu-tunggu itu .


Libya's Gaddafi: Death to All for Everything · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Libya Uprising 2011.
Libya's dictator Muammar Al Gaddafi just gave a furious speech on Libyan State TV today, Tuesday, warning and threatening anti-government protesters and their supporters, that the Libya would end up like Afghanistan, Iraq, or Somalia.
He encouraged Libyans to come out of their homes tomorrow and chase down "the terrorists" and hand them in to security forces so they could be "punished with death".
He said he would keep fighting for Libya till "his last drop of blood" and went on to list in great detail every single thing that would be punished with death, including working for a foreign organization, using force against government forces, or threatening the unity of the country.
The rambling, apparently unscripted speech was followed by Libyans, Arabs, and citizens everywhere on Twitter, and evoked both sarcasm and ridicule, even amidst the tragic circumstances of death and instability in the country.
Gaddafi justified Libya's brutal crackdown on protests in recent days, listing other moments in history when governments have killed protesters, saying things like, "The unity of China, was more important that those on Tianamen Square."
Tomorrow, he said, youth (those not "on drugs") should form committees to defend his revolution.
"You are more than them," he said.
In the wait leading up to his speech, tweeple humorously guessed why he was late in giving his anticipated speech.
